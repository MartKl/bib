For any fixed 0 < p < 1, we prove that finding the global minimal value of the problem is strongly NP-Hard, but computing a local minimizer of the problem can be done in polynomial time. We also develop an interior-point potential reduction algorithm with a provable complexity bound and demonstrate preliminary computational results of effectiveness of the algorithm.",

Leakage errors pose a distinct challenge to quantum control relative to the more well-studied decoherence errors and can be a limiting factor to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we present a scalable and robust randomized benchmarking protocol for quickly estimating the leakage rate due to an arbitrary Markovian noise process on a larger system. We illustrate the reliability of the protocol through numerical simulations.},

abstract="The subject of this article is the duality principle, which, well beyond its stand at the heart of Gabor analysis, is a universal principle in frame theory that gives insight into many phenomena. Its fiber matrix formulation for Gabor systems is the driving principle behind seemingly different results. We show how the classical duality identities, operator representations and constructions for dual Gabor frames are in fact aspects of the dual Gramian matrix fiberization and its sole duality principle, giving a unified view to all of them. We show that the same duality principle, via dual Gramian matrix analysis, holds for dual (or bi-) systems in abstract Hilbert spaces. The essence of the duality principle is the unitary equivalence of the frame operator and the Gramian of certain adjoint systems. An immediate consequence is, for example, that, even on this level of generality, dual frames are characterized in terms of biorthogonality relations of adjoint systems. We formulate the duality principle for irregular Gabor systems which have no structure whatsoever to the sampling of the shifts and modulations of the generating window. In case the shifts and modulations are sampled from lattices we show how the abstract matrices can be reduced to the simple structured fiber matrices of shift-invariant systems, thus arriving back in the well understood territory. Moreover, in the arena of multiresolution analysis (MRA)-wavelet frames, the mixed unitary extension principle can be viewed as the duality principle in a sequence space. This perspective leads to a construction scheme for dual wavelet frames which is strikingly simple in the sense that it only needs the completion of an invertible constant matrix. Under minimal conditions on the MRA, our construction guarantees the existence and easy constructability of non-separable multivariate dual MRA-wavelet frames. The wavelets have compact support and we show examples for multivariate interpolatory refinable functions. Finally, we generalize the duality principle to the case of transforms that are no longer defined by discrete systems, but may have discrete adjoint systems.",

  Abstract                 = {Compressed sensing is a technique to sample compressible signals below the Nyquist rate, whilst still allowing near optimal reconstruction of the signal. In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the iterative hard thresholding algorithm when applied to the compressed sensing recovery problem. We show that the algorithm has the following properties (made more precise in the main text of the paper)• It gives near-optimal error guarantees. • It is robust to observation noise. • It succeeds with a minimum number of observations. • It can be used with any sampling operator for which the operator and its adjoint can be computed. • The memory requirement is linear in the problem size. • Its computational complexity per iteration is of the same order as the application of the measurement operator or its adjoint. • It requires a fixed number of iterations depending only on the logarithm of a form of signal to noise ratio of the signal. • Its performance guarantees are uniform in that they only depend on properties of the sampling operator and signal sparsity. },

  Abstract                 = {We consider an isolated autonomous quantum machine, where an explicit quantum clock is responsible for performing all transformations on an arbitrary quantum system (the engine), via a time-independent Hamiltonian. In a general context, we show that this model can exactly implement any energy-conserving unitary on the engine, without degrading the clock. Furthermore, we show that when the engine includes a quantum work storage device we can approximately perform completely general unitaries on the remainder of the engine. This framework can be used in quantum thermodynamics to carry out arbitrary transformations of a system, with accuracy and extracted work as close to optimal as desired, while obeying the first and second laws of thermodynamics. We thus show that autonomous thermal machines suffer no intrinsic thermodynamic cost compared to externally controlled ones.},

	Abstract = {We describe a scalable stochastic method for the experimental measurement of generalized fidelities characterizing the accuracy of the implementation of a coherent quantum transformation. The method is based on the motion reversal of random unitary operators. In the simplest case our method enables direct estimation of the average gate fidelity. The more general fidelities are characterized by a universal exponential rate of fidelity loss. In all cases the measurable fidelity decrease is directly related to the strength of the noise affecting the implementation, quantified by the trace of the superoperator describing the non-unitary dynamics. While the scalability of our stochastic protocol makes it most relevant in large Hilbert spaces (when quantum process tomography is infeasible), our method should be immediately useful for evaluating the degree of control that is achievable in any prototype quantum processing device. By varying over different experimental arrangements and error-correction strategies, additional information about the noise can be determined.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speed-ups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up fundamental questions, among them the issue of whether quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computation. We show, in theory and experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced here uses the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is required only to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier 
can test the computer/'s ability to perform quantum computation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper considers the question of recovering the phase of an object from intensity-only measurements, a problem which naturally appears in X-ray crystallography and related disciplines. We study a physically realistic setup where one can modulate the signal of interest and then collect the intensity of its diffraction pattern, each modulation thereby producing a sort of coded diffraction pattern. We show that PhaseLift, a recent convex programming technique, recovers the phase information exactly from a number of random modulations, which is polylogarithmic in the number of unknowns. Numerical experiments with noiseless and noisy data complement our theoretical analysis and illustrate our approach. },

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the description of quantum many-body mixed states using matrix product states and operators. We consider two such descriptions: (i) as a matrix product density operator of bond dimension D ; and (ii) as a purification that is written as a matrix product state of bond dimension D ′. We show that these descriptions are inequivalent in the sense that D ′ cannot be upper bounded by D only. Then we provide two constructive methods to obtain (ii) out of (i). The sum of squares (sos) polynomial method scales exponentially in the number of different eigenvalues, and its approximate version is formulated as a semidefinite program, which gives efficient approximate purifications whose D ′ only depends on D . The eigenbasis method scales quadratically in the number of eigenvalues, and its approximate version is very efficient for rapidly decaying distributions of eigenvalues. Our results imply that a description of mixed states which is both efficient and locally positive semidefinite does not exist, but that good approximations do.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider sparsity on a tensor level, as given by the n-rank of a tensor. In an important sparse-vector approximation problem (compressed sensing) and the low-rank matrix recovery problem, using a convex relaxation technique proved to be a valuable solution strategy. Here, we will adapt these techniques to the tensor setting. We use the n-rank of a tensor as a sparsity measure and consider the low-n-rank tensor recovery problem, i.e. the problem of finding the tensor of the lowest n-rank that fulfills some linear constraints. We introduce a tractable convex relaxation of the n-rank and propose efficient algorithms to solve the low-n-rank tensor recovery problem numerically. The algorithms are based on the Douglas-Rachford splitting technique and its dual variant, the alternating direction method of multipliers.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum information processing offers promising advances for a wide range of fields and applications, provided that we can efficiently assess the performance of the control applied in candidate systems. That is, we must be able to determine whether we have implemented a desired gate, and refine accordingly. Randomized benchmarking reduces the difficulty of this task by exploiting symmetries in quantum operations. Here, we bound the resources required for benchmarking and show that, with prior information, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy than in traditional approaches to benchmarking. Moreover, by building on state-of-the-art classical algorithms, we reach these accuracies with near-optimal resources. Our approach requires an order of magnitude less data to achieve the same accuracies and to provide online estimates of the errors in the reported fidelities. We also show that our approach is useful for physical devices by comparing to simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {This work may be considered a completion of the paper by J. de Pillis: Linear transformations which preserve Hermitian and positive semidefinite operators, published in 1967 [2]: necessary conditions have been formulated. Let \{A1\} be the full algebra of linear operators on the n-dimensional Hilbert space H1, and let \{A2\} be the full algebra of linear operators on the m-dimensional Hilbert space H2. Let L(A1,A2) denote the complex spaceof linear maps from \{A1\} to \{A2\} and S denotes the cone of all T ϵ L(A1,A2 which send positive semidefinite operators from \{A1\} to positive semidefinite operators from A2. The aim of this paper is to present a necessary and sufficient condition for a transformation in L(A1, A2) to be in the cone S, and to preserve trace of the operators. },

  Abstract                 = {The density matrix renormalization group method has been extensively used to study the ground state of 1D many-body systems since its introduction two decades ago. In spite of its wide use, this heuristic method is known to fail in certain cases and no certifiably correct implementation is known, leaving researchers faced with an ever-growing toolbox of heuristics, none of which is guaranteed to succeed. Here we develop a polynomial time algorithm that provably finds the ground state of any 1D quantum system described by a gapped local Hamiltonian with constant ground-state energy. The algorithm is based on a framework that combines recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D systems with an efficient construction of a class of operators called approximate ground-state projections (AGSPs). The combination of these tools yields a method that is guaranteed to succeed in all 1D gapped systems. An AGSP-centric approach may help guide the search for algorithms for more 
general quantum systems, including for the central challenge of 2D systems, where even heuristic methods have had more limited success.},

  Abstract                 = { We review recent developments in the physics of ultracold atomic and molecular gases in optical lattices. Such systems are nearly perfect realisations of various kinds of Hubbard models, and as such may very well serve to mimic condensed matter phenomena. We show how these systems may be employed as quantum simulators to answer some challenging open questions of condensed matter, and even high energy physics. After a short presentation of the models and the methods of treatment of such systems, we discuss in detail, which challenges of condensed matter physics can be addressed with (i) disordered ultracold lattice gases, (ii) frustrated ultracold gases, (iii) spinor lattice gases, (iv) lattice gases in “artificial” magnetic fields, and, last but not least, (v) quantum information processing in lattice gases. For completeness, also some recent progress related to the above topics with trapped cold gases will be discussed. Motto: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

Quantum states and operations can be protected from errors through the use of protocols for quantum computing with faulty components. We present a quantum error-correcting code in which one qubit is encoded in entangled states distributed over seven trapped-ion qubits. The code can detect one bit flip error, one phase flip error, or a combined error of both, regardless on which of the qubits they occur. We applied sequences of gate operations on the encoded qubit to explore its computational capabilities. This seven-qubit code represents a fully functional instance of a topologically encoded qubit, or color code, and opens a route toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

  abstract={We describe two related methods for reconstructing multi-scale entangled states from a small number of efficiently-implementable measurements and fast post-processing. Both methods only require single-particle measurements and the total number of measurements is polynomial in the number of particles. Data post-processing for state reconstruction uses standard tools, namely matrix diagonalization and conjugate gradient method, and scales polynomially with the number of particles. Both methods prevent the build-up of errors from both numerical and experimental imperfections. The first method is conceptually simpler but requires unitary control. The second method circumvents the need for unitary control but requires more measurements and produces an estimated state of lower fidelity.}

  Abstract                 = {Randomized benchmarking is a promising tool for characterizing the noise in experimental implementations of quantum systems. In this paper, we prove that the estimates produced by randomized benchmarking (both standard and interleaved) for arbitrary Markovian noise sources are remarkably precise by showing that the variance due to sampling random gate sequences is small. We discuss how to choose experimental parameters, in particular the number and lengths of random sequences, in order to characterize average gate errors with rigorous confidence bounds. We also show that randomized benchmarking can be used to reliably characterize time-dependent Markovian noise (e.g., when noise is due to a magnetic field with fluctuating strength). Moreover, we identify a necessary property for time-dependent noise that is violated by some sources of non-Markovian noise, which provides a test for non-Markovianity.},

  Abstract                 = {A major problem facing the development of quantum computers or large scale quantum simulators is that general methods for characterizing and controlling are intractable. We provide a new approach to this problem that uses small quantum simulators to efficiently characterize and learn control models for larger devices. Our protocol achieves this by using Bayesian inference in concert with Lieb–Robinson bounds and interactive quantum learning methods to achieve compressed simulations for characterization. We also show that the Lieb–Robinson velocity is epistemic for our protocol, meaning that information propagates at a rate that depends on the uncertainty in the system Hamiltonian. We illustrate the efficiency of our bootstrapping protocol by showing numerically that an 8 qubit Ising model simulator can be used to calibrate and control a 50 qubit Ising simulator while using only about 750 kilobits of experimental data. Finally, we provide upper bounds for the Fisher information 
that show that the number of experiments needed to characterize a system rapidly diverges as the duration of the experiments used in the characterization shrinks, which motivates the use of methods such as ours that do not require short evolution times.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of quantum-state tomography under the assumption that the state is pure, and more generally that its rank is bounded by a given value r. In this scenario two notions of informationally complete measurements emerge: rank-r-complete measurements and rank-r strictly-complete measurements. Whereas in the first notion, a rank-r state is uniquely identified from within the set of rank-r states, in the second notion the same state is uniquely identified from within the set of all physical states, of any rank. We argue, therefore, that strictly-complete measurements are compatible with convex optimization, and we prove that they allow robust quantum-state estimation in the presence of experimental noise. We also show that rank-r strictly-complete measurements are as efficient as rank-r-complete measurements. We construct examples of strictly-complete measurements and give a complete description of their structure in the context of matrix completion. Moreover, we numerically show that a few random bases form such measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency-robustness property for different strictly-complete measurements with numerical experiments. We thus conclude that only strictly-complete measurements are useful for practical tomography.},

Our numerical scaling analysis shows that all of these quantities can be reproduced efficiently, with a number of random gates which scales at most as nq[ln(nq/ϵ)]ν with the number of qubits nq for a given fixed precision ϵ and ν{\textgreater}0.},

Various scales of time and various initial distribution are concerned, giving rise to various limit processes, related to the geometric construction of the unitary Brownian motion. As an application, we propose a quite short proof of the asymptotic Gaussian feature of the linear combinations of the entries of Haar distributed random unitary matrices, a result already proved by Diaconis et al.},

  Abstract                 = {A critical milestone on the path to useful quantum computers is quantum supremacy - a demonstration of a quantum computation that is prohibitively hard for classical computers. A leading near-term candidate, put forth by the Google/UCSB team, is sampling from the probability distributions of randomly chosen quantum circuits, which we call Random Circuit Sampling (RCS). In this paper we study both the hardness and verification of RCS. While RCS was defined with experimental realization in mind, we show complexity theoretic evidence of hardness that is on par with the strongest theoretical proposals for supremacy. Specifically, we show that RCS satisfies an average-case hardness condition - computing output probabilities of typical quantum circuits is as hard as computing them in the worst-case, and therefore \#P-hard. Our reduction exploits the polynomial structure in the output amplitudes of random quantum circuits, enabled by the Feynman path integral. In addition, it follows from known results that RCS satisfies an anti-concentration property, making it the first supremacy proposal with both average-case hardness and anti-concentration.},

Such a set is necessary to perform quantum computation in a realistic noisy environment. The new basis consists only of two single-qubit gates (Hadamard and σz1/4), and one two-qubit gate (Controlled-NOT). Moreover, a new general method for fault-tolerant implementation of quantum gates like Toffoli is introduced. This method is a generalization of the methods suggested by Shor (Proc. FOCS'96, 1996, p. 56) and later by Knill et al. (Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 454 (1998) 365).},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate disordered one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg spin lattices across the transition from integrability to quantum chaos from both statistical many-body and quantum-information perspectives. Special emphasis is devoted to quantitatively exploring the interplay between eigenvector statistics, delocalization, and entanglement in the presence of nontrivial symmetries. The implication of the basis dependence of state delocalization indicators (such as the number of principal components) is addressed, and a measure of relative delocalization is proposed in order to robustly characterize the onset of chaos in the presence of disorder. Both standard multipartite and generalized entanglement are investigated in a wide parameter regime by using a family of spin- and fermion-purity measures, their dependence on delocalization and on energy spectrum statistics being examined. A distinctive correlation between entanglement, delocalization, and integrability is uncovered, which may be generic to systems described by the two-body random ensemble and may point to a new diagnostic tool for quantum chaos. Analytical estimates for typical entanglement of random pure states restricted to a proper subspace of the full Hilbert space are also established and compared with random matrix theory predictions.},

We show that exact unitary 2-designs on n qubits can be implemented by quantum circuits consisting of {\textasciitilde}O(n) elementary gates in logarithmic depth. This is essentially a quadratic improvement in size (and in width times depth) over all previous implementations that are exact or approximate (for sufficiently strong approximations).},

We show that the fact that the ray optics (classical dynamics) is chaotic, implies fluctuations in the observed transmission coefficients, whose statistics is determined by the theory of random matrices. We also show how the classical distribution functions which reflect the chaotic nature of the classical dynamics, determine the dependence of the correlations observed in the fluctuating transmission coefficients on external parameters. The time domain properties of chaotic scattering systems are also examined, and are shown to depend on the chaotic nature of the classical dynamics, together with a wave mechanical enhancement in time reversal invariant systems. Finally, we study the role of absorption and discuss its effects on the transmission fluctuations and their statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantum dynamics of a classically chaotic model are studied in the approach to the macroscopic limit. The quantum predictions are compared and contrasted with the classical predictions of both Newtonian and Liouville mechanics. The time-domain scaling of the optimal quantum-classical correspondence is analyzed in detail in the case of both classical theories. In both cases the correspondence for observable quantities is shown to break down on a time-scale that increases very slowly (logarithmically) with increasing system size. In the case of quantum-Liouville correspondence such a short time-scale does not imply a breakdown of correspondence since the largest quantum-Liouville differences reached on this time-scale decrease rapidly (as an inverse power) with increasing system size. Therefore the statistical properties of chaotic dynamics are, as expected, well described by quantum theory in the macroscopic limit. In contrast, the largest quantum-Newtonian differences reached on the log time-scale actually increase in proportion to the system size. Since the invariance properties of the Hamiltonian impose functional constraints on the time-varying chaotic coordinates, it is possible to show, moreover, that if the quantum predictions are believed to describe the coordinates of individual chaotic systems, then they also predict macroscopic violations of any kinematic or dynamic constants of the motion. These results for chaotic systems indicate that a valid description of the time-varying properties of individual macroscopic bodies is not available within the standard interpretive framework of quantum theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work has connected the type of fidelity decay in perturbed quantum models to the presence of chaos in the associated classical models. We demonstrate that a system's rate of fidelity decay under repeated perturbations may be measured efficiently on a quantum information processor, and analyze the conditions under which this indicator is a reliable probe of quantum chaos and related statistical properties of the unperturbed system. The type and rate of the decay are not dependent on the eigenvalue statistics of the unperturbed system, but depend on the system's eigenvector statistics in the eigenbasis of the perturbation operator. For random eigenvector statistics the decay is exponential with a rate fixed precisely by the variance of the perturbation's energy spectrum. Hence, even classically regular models can exhibit an exponential fidelity decay under generic quantum perturbations. These results clarify which perturbations can distinguish classically regular and chaotic quantum systems.},

Here we introduce a method for generating pseudo-random unitary operators that can reproduce those statistical properties of random unitary operators most relevant to quantum information tasks. This method requires exponentially fewer resources, and hence enables the practical application of random unitary operators in quantum communication and information processing protocols. Using a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor, we were able to realize pseudorandom unitary operators that reproduce the expected random distribution of matrix elements.},

  Abstract                 = {Instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) computation is a class of quantum computation consisting only of commuting two-qubit gates and is not universal. Nevertheless, it has been shown that if there is a classical algorithm that can simulate IQP efficiently, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level, which is highly implausible. However, the origin of the classical intractability is still less understood. Here we establish a relationship between IQP and computational complexity of calculating the imaginary-valued partition functions of Ising models. We apply the established relationship in two opposite directions. One direction is to find subclasses of IQP that are classically efficiently simulatable by using exact solvability of certain types of Ising models. Another direction is applying quantum computational complexity of IQP to investigate (im)possibility of efficient classical approximations of Ising partition functions with imaginary coupling constants. Specifically, we show that a multiplicative approximation of Ising partition functions is \#P-hard for almost all imaginary coupling constants even on planar lattices of a bounded degree.},

The known schemes heavily rely on mathematical assumptions that are plausible but unproven, prominently results on anticoncentration of random prescriptions. In this work, we aim at closing the gap by proving two anticoncentration theorems and accompanying hardness results, one for circuit-based schemes, the other for quantum quench-type schemes for quantum simulations. Compared to the few other known such results, these results give rise to a number of comparably simple, physically meaningful and resource-economical schemes showing a quantum speedup in one and two spatial dimensions. At the heart of the analysis are tools of unitary designs and random circuits that allow us to conclude that universal random circuits anticoncentrate as well as an embedding of known circuit-based schemes in a 2D translation-invariant architecture.},

It is computationally equivalent to the circuit model. Unlike the circuit model, however, its classical analog is little studied. Here we present a classical analog of MBQC whose computational complexity presents a rich structure. To do so, we identify uniform families of quantum computations [refining the circuits introduced by Bremner Proc. R. Soc. A 467, 459 (2010)] whose output is likely hard to exactly simulate (sample) classically. We demonstrate that these circuit families can be efficiently implemented in the MBQC model without adaptive measurement and, thus, can be achieved in a classical analog of MBQC whose resource state is a probability distribution which has been created quantum mechanically. Such states (by definition) violate no Bell inequality, but, if widely held beliefs about computational complexity are true, they, nevertheless, exhibit nonclassicality when used as a computational resource—an imprint of their quantum origin.},

Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the butterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic definition of scrambling.},

Thus we explicitly demonstrate that the spreading of entanglement is much faster than the energy diffusion in this nonintegrable system.},

We provide an adaption for the symplectic group Sp(2n,F\_2) which provides, in addition to a canonical mapping from the integers to group elements g, a factorization of g into a sequence of at most 4n symplectic transvections. The algorithm can be used to efficiently select randomelements of C\_n which is often useful in quantum information theory and quantum computation.

  Abstract                 = {This thesis discusses the young fields of quantum pseudo-randomness and quantum learning algorithms. We present techniques for derandomising algorithms to decrease randomness resource requirements and improve efficiency. One key object in doing this is a k-design, which is a distribution on the unitary group whose kth moments match those of the unitarily invariant Haar measure. We show that for a natural model of a random quantum circuit, the distribution of random circuits quickly converges to a 2-design. We then present an efficient unitary k-design construction for any k, provided the number of qubits n satisfies k = O(n/log n). In doing this, we provide an efficient construction of a quantum tensor product expander, which is a generalisation of a quantum expander which in turn generalises classical expanders. We then discuss applications of k-designs. We show that they can be used to improve the efficiency of many existing algorithms and protocols and also find new applications to derandomising large deviation bounds. In particular, we show that many large deviation bound results for Haar random unitaries carry over to k-designs for k = poly(n). In the second part of the thesis, we present some learning and testing algorithms for the Clifford group. We find an optimal algorithm for identifying an unknown Clifford operation. We also give an algorithm to test if an unknown operation is close to a Clifford or far from every Clifford.},

  Abstract                 = {While quantum speed-up in solving certain decision problems by a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer has been promised, a timely research interest includes how far one can reduce the resource requirement to demonstrate a provable advantage in quantum devices without demanding quantum error correction, which is crucial for prolonging the coherence time of qubits. We propose a model device made of locally interacting multiple qubits, designed such that simultaneous single-qubit measurements on it can output probability distributions whose average-case sampling is classically intractable, under similar assumptions as the sampling of noninteracting bosons and instantaneous quantum circuits. Notably, in contrast to these previous unitary-based realizations, our measurement-based implementation has two distinctive features. (i) Our implementation involves no adaptation of measurement bases, leading output probability distributions to be generated in constant time, independent of the system size. Thus, it could be implemented in principle without quantum error correction. (ii) Verifying the classical intractability of our sampling is done by changing the Pauli measurement bases only at certain output qubits. Our usage of random commuting quantum circuits in place of computationally universal circuits allows a unique unification of sampling and verification, so they require the same physical resource requirements in contrast to the more demanding verification protocols seen elsewhere in the literature.},

In spite of the severe restriction, the model can solve several problems (such as calculating Jones polynomials) whose classical efficient solutions are not known. Furthermore, it was shown that if the output probability distribution of the one-clean-qubit model can be classically efficiently sampled with a constant multiplicative error, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. Is it possible to improve the multiplicative error hardness result to a constant total variation distance error one like other subuniversal quantum computing models such as the IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial time) model, the boson sampling model, and the Fourier sampling model? In this paper we show that it is indeed possible if we accept a modified version of the average case hardness conjecture. Interestingly, the anticoncentration lemma can be easily shown by using the special property of the one-clean-qubit model that each output probability is so small that no concentration occurs.},

Indeed, while being a restricted class, commuting circuits exhibit genuine quantum effects such as entanglement. In this paper we show that the computational power of commuting circuits exhibits a surprisingly rich structure. First we show that every 2-local commuting circuit acting on d-level systems and followed by single-qudit measurements can be efficiently simulated classically with high accuracy. In contrast, we prove that such strong simulations are hard for 3-local circuits. Using sampling methods we further show that all commuting circuits composed of exponentiated Pauli operators e{\textasciicircum}\{i{\textbackslash}theta P\} can be simulated efficiently classically when followed by single-qubit measurements. Finally, we show that commuting circuits can efficiently simulate certain non-commutative processes, related in particular to constant-depth quantum circuits. This gives evidence that the power of commuting circuits goes beyond classical computation.},

  Abstract                 = {Entangled multipartite states are resources for universal quantum computation, but they can also give rise to ensembles of unitary transformations, a topic usually studied in the context of random quantum circuits. Using several graph state techniques, we show that these resources can “derandomize” circuit results by sampling the same kinds of ensembles quantum mechanically, analogously to a quantum random number generator. Furthermore, we find simple examples that give rise to new ensembles whose statistical moments exactly match those of the uniformly random distribution over all unitaries up to order t, while foregoing adaptive feedforward entirely. Such ensembles—known as t designs—often cannot be distinguished from the “truly” random ensemble, and so they find use in many applications that require this implied notion of pseudorandomness.},

	abstract = {We show that several quantum circuit families can be simulated efficiently classically if it is promised that their output distribution is approximately sparse i.e. the distribution is close to one where only a polynomially small, a priori unknown subset of the measurement probabilities are nonzero. Classical simulations are thereby obtained for quantum circuits which---without the additional sparsity promise---are considered hard to simulate. Our results apply in particular to a family of Fourier sampling circuits (which have structural similarities to Shor's factoring algorithm) but also to several other circuit families, such as IQP circuits. Our results provide examples of quantum circuits that cannot achieve exponential speed-ups due to the presence of too much destructive interference i.e. too many cancelations of amplitudes. The crux of our classical simulation is an efficient algorithm for approximating the significant Fourier coefficients of a class of states called computationally tractable states. The latter result may have applications beyond the scope of this work. In the proof we employ and extend sparse approximation techniques, in particular the Kushilevitz-Mansour algorithm, in combination with probabilistic simulation methods for quantum circuits.},

	abstract = {We study the sensitivity to noise of {\textbar}permanent(X){\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2 for random real and complex n x n Gaussian matrices X, and show that asymptotically the correlation between the noisy and noiseless outcomes tends to zero when the noise level is \{{\textbackslash}omega\}(1)/n. This suggests that, under certain reasonable noise models, the probability distributions produced by noisy BosonSampling are very sensitive to noise. We also show that when the amount of noise is constant the noisy value of {\textbar}permanent(X){\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2 can be approximated efficiently on a classical computer. These results seem to weaken the possibility of demonstrating quantum-speedup via BosonSampling without quantum fault-tolerance.},

	abstract = {A boson sampling device is a specialised quantum computer that solves a problem which is strongly believed to be computationally hard for classical computers. Recently a number of small-scale implementations have been reported, all based on multi-photon interference in multimode interferometers. In the hard-to-simulate regime, even validating the device's functioning may pose a problem . In a recent paper, Gogolin et al. showed that so-called symmetric algorithms would be unable to distinguish the experimental distribution from the trivial, uniform distribution. Here we report new boson sampling experiments on larger photonic chips, and analyse the data using a scalable statistical test recently proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov. We show the test successfully validates small experimental data samples against the hypothesis that they are uniformly distributed. We also show how to discriminate data arising from either indistinguishable or distinguishable photons. Our results pave the way towards larger boson sampling experiments whose functioning, despite being non-trivial to simulate, can be certified against alternative hypotheses.},

	abstract = {It is predicted that quantum computers will dramatically outperform their conventional counterparts. However, large-scale universal quantum computers are yet to be built. Boson sampling is a rudimentary quantum algorithm tailored to the platform of linear optics, which has sparked interest as a rapid way to demonstrate such quantum supremacy. Photon statistics are governed by intractable matrix functions, which suggests that sampling from the distribution obtained by injecting photons into a linear optical network could be solved more quickly by a photonic experiment than by a classical computer. The apparently low resource requirements for large boson sampling experiments have raised expectations of a near-term demonstration of quantum supremacy by boson sampling. Here we present classical boson sampling algorithms and theoretical analyses of prospects for scaling boson sampling experiments, showing that near-term quantum supremacy via boson sampling is unlikely. Our classical algorithm, based on Metropolised independence sampling, allowed the boson sampling problem to be solved for 30 photons with standard computing hardware. Compared to current experiments, a demonstration of quantum supremacy over a successful implementation of these classical methods on a supercomputer would require the number of photons and experimental components to increase by orders of magnitude, while tackling exponentially scaling photon loss.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({\textless};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- {\textbar}{\textbar}},

	abstract = {We present several polynomial- and quasipolynomial-time approximation schemes for a large class of generalized operator norms. Special cases include the \$2{\textbackslash}rightarrow q\$ norm of matrices for \$q{\textgreater}2\$, the support function of the set of separable quantum states, finding the least noisy output of entanglement-breaking quantum channels, and approximating the injective tensor norm for a map between two Banach spaces whose factorization norm through \${\textbackslash}ell\_1{\textasciicircum}n\$ is bounded. These reproduce and in some cases improve upon the performance of previous algorithms by Brand{\textbackslash}{\textasciitilde}ao-Christandl-Yard and followup work, which were based on the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy and whose analysis used techniques from quantum information such as the monogamy principle of entanglement. Our algorithms, by contrast, are based on brute force enumeration over carefully chosen covering nets. These have the advantage of using less memory, having much simpler proofs and giving new geometric insights into the problem. Net-based algorithms for similar problems were also presented by Shi-Wu and Barak-Kelner-Steurer, but in each case with a run-time that is exponential in the rank of some matrix. We achieve polynomial or quasipolynomial runtimes by using the much smaller nets that exist in \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ spaces. This principle has been used in learning theory, where it is known as Maurey's empirical method.},

The orthogonal rank of a graph is the smallest number \$d\$ for which one can label each vertex with a nonzero \$d\$-dimensional complex vector such that adjacent vertices receive orthogonal vectors. We show an exp\$(n)\$ lower bound on the orthogonal rank of the graph on \${\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}n\$ in which two strings are adjacent if they have Hamming distance at least \$n/2\$.

This crucially requires a notion of distance between functions. The most prevalent notion is the Hamming distance over the uniform distribution on the domain. This restriction to uniformity is more a matter of convenience than of necessity, and it is important to investigate distances induced by more general distributions. In this paper, we make signiﬁcant strides in this direction. We give simple and optimal testers for bounded derivative properties over arbitrary product distributions. Bounded derivative properties include fundamental properties such as monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. Our results subsume almost all known results (upper and lower bounds) on monotonicity and Lipschitz testing.},

	abstract = {The area of property testing tries to design algorithms that can efficiently handle very large amounts of data: given a large object that either has a certain property or is somehow "far" from having that property, a tester should efficiently distinguish between these two cases. In this survey we describe recent results obtained for quantum property testing. This area naturally falls into three parts. First, we may consider quantum testers for properties of classical objects. We survey the main examples known where quantum testers can be much (sometimes exponentially) more efficient than classical testers. Second, we may consider classical testers of quantum objects. This is the situation that arises for instance when one is trying to determine if quantum states or operations do what they are supposed to do, based only on classical input-output behavior. Finally, we may also consider quantum testers for properties of quantum objects, such as states or operations. We survey known bounds on testing various natural properties, such as whether two states are equal, whether a state is separable, whether two operations commute, etc. We also highlight connections to other areas of quantum information theory and mention a number of open questions.},

	abstract = {We study the computational power of unitary Clifford circuits with solely magic state inputs (CM circuits), supplemented by classical efficient computation. We show that CM circuits are hard to classically simulate up to multiplicative error (assuming PH non-collapse), and also up to additive error under plausible average-case hardness conjectures. Unlike other such known classes, a broad variety of possible conjectures apply. Along the way we give an extension of the Gottesman-Knill theorem that applies to universal computation, showing that for Clifford circuits with joint stabiliser and non-stabiliser inputs, the stabiliser part can be eliminated in favour of classical simulation, leaving a Clifford circuit on only the non-stabiliser part. Finally we discuss implementational advantages of CM circuits.},

	abstract = {One of the outstanding problems in non-equilibrium physics is to precisely understand when and how physically relevant observables in many-body systems equilibrate under unitary time evolution. While general equilibration results have been proven that show that equilibration is generic provided that the initial state has overlap with sufficiently many energy levels, at the same time results showing that natural initial states fulfill this condition are lacking. In this work, we present stringent results for equilibration for ergodic systems in which the amount of entanglement in energy eigenstates with finite energy density grows volume-like with the system size. Concretely, we carefully formalize notions of entanglement-ergodicity in terms of R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropies, from which we derive that such systems equilibrate exponentially well. Our proof uses insights about R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropies and combines them with recent results about the probability distribution of energy in lattice systems with initial states that are weakly correlated.},

Lett. 100, 110501 (2008)], the partition function of the 2D square lattice Ising model in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, can specialize to the partition function of any Ising system on an arbitrary graph. In this sense the 2D Ising model is said to be "complete". However, in order to obtain the above result, the coupling strengths on the 2D lattice must assume complex values, and thus do not allow for a physical interpretation. Here we show how a complete model with real -and, hence, "physical"- couplings can be obtained if the 3D Ising model is considered. We furthermore show how to map general q-state systems with possibly many-body interactions to the 2D Ising model with complex parameters, and give completeness results for these models with real parameters. We also demonstrate that the computational overhead in these constructions is in all relevant cases polynomial. These results are proved by invoking a recently found cross-connection between statistical mechanics and quantum information theory, where partition functions are expressed as quantum mechanical amplitudes. Within this framework, there exists a natural correspondence between many-body quantum states that allow universal quantum computation via local measurements only, and complete classical spin systems.},

	abstract = {We develop a fundamental framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MQC), by examining the many-body entangled states which possess symmetry-protected topological order (SPTO). We first show that the 2D cluster state, an archetypal universal resource state for MQC defined on a 2D lattice, has nonexistent 2D SPTO, but does possess some nontrivial SPTO of the same nature as 1D spin chains. This property holds true not only for the 2D cluster state, but also for a wide range of previously known universal resource states. Here, in contrast, we introduce the first instance of a universal resource state for MQC which is a ground state of genuine 2D SPTO. The 2D nature of our state's SPTO enables a distinct property from the 2D cluster state, called Pauli universality, where universal quantum computation is possible simply by measurements in the single-qubit Pauli X, Y, and Z bases. Our results open up a research avenue to take advantage of greater quantum-gate complexity within the so-called Clifford hierarchy in terms of the entanglement structure contained in genuine higher-dimensional SPTO.},

Since it has been proven that IQP circuits are unlikely to be simulated classically up to a multiplicative error and an error in l1 norm, IQP is considered as one of the promising classes that demonstrates quantum supremacy. Although IQP circuits can be realized more easily than a universal quantum computer, demonstrating quantum supremacy is still difficult. It is therefore desired to find subclasses of IQP that are easy to implement. In this paper, by imposing some restrictions on IQP, we propose ancilla-driven IQP (ADIQP) as the subclass of commuting quantum computation suitable for many experimental settings. We show that even though ADIQP circuits are strictly weaker than IQP circuits in a sense, they are also hard to simulate classically up to a multiplicative error and an error in l1 norm. Moreover, the properties of ADIQP make it easy to investigate the verifiability of ADIQP circuits and the difficulties in realizing ADIQP circuits.},

	abstract = {Quantum annealing (QA) is a hardware-based heuristic optimization and sampling method applicable to discrete undirected graphical models. While similar to simulated annealing, QA relies on quantum, rather than thermal, effects to explore complex search spaces. For many classes of problems, QA is known to offer computational advantages over simulated annealing. Here we report on the ability of recent QA hardware to accelerate training of fully visible Boltzmann machines. We characterize the sampling distribution of QA hardware, and show that in many cases, the quantum distributions differ significantly from classical Boltzmann distributions. In spite of this difference, training (which seeks to match data and model statistics) using standard classical gradient updates is still effective. We investigate the use of QA for seeding Markov chains as an alternative to contrastive divergence (CD) and persistent contrastive divergence (PCD). Using \$k=50\$ Gibbs steps, we show that for problems with high-energy barriers between modes, QA-based seeds can improve upon chains with CD and PCD initializations. For these hard problems, QA gradient estimates are more accurate, and allow for faster learning. Furthermore, and interestingly, even the case of raw QA samples (that is, \$k=0\$) achieved similar improvements. We argue that this relates to the fact that we are training a quantum rather than classical Boltzmann distribution in this case. The learned parameters give rise to hardware QA distributions closely approximating classical Boltzmann distributions that are hard to train with CD/PCD.},

	abstract = {With the production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate understanding of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring quantum magnetism. In ordinary atomic systems, where contact interactions require wavefunction overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be mediated by tunnelling, through a process referred to as superexchange; however, the coupling is relatively weak and is limited to nearest-neighbour interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist even in the absence of tunnelling and extend beyond nearest neighbours. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even for gases with relatively high entropy and low lattice filling. Measured effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have been limited to the modification of inelastic collisions and chemical reactions. Here we use dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice to realize a lattice spin model. Spin is encoded in rotational states of molecules that are prepared and probed by microwaves. Resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules realizes a spin-exchange interaction. The dipolar interactions are apparent in the evolution of the spin coherence, which shows oscillations in addition to an overall decay of the coherence. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling factor and the effect of a multipulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a continuous quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these tunnelling-induced losses allow us to determine the lattice filling factor independently. Our work constitutes an initial exploration of the behaviour of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lays the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.},

Two magnets interact with each other through a force that depends on the distance between them and on their mutual orientation. How do these long-range dipolar forces affect the behavior of a system of many magnets? Baier et al. used a gas of erbium atoms, which have a large magnetic moment, to answer this question. The gas—which they “housed” in an optical lattice—underwent a transition from a superfluid to an insulating state, revealing the presence of dipolar interactions through the orientation dependence of various properties.
Science, this issue p. 201
The Hubbard model underlies our understanding of strongly correlated materials. Whereas its standard form only comprises interactions between particles at the same lattice site, extending it to encompass long-range interactions is predicted to profoundly alter the quantum behavior of the system. We realize the extended Bose-Hubbard model for an ultracold gas of strongly magnetic erbium atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice. Controlling the orientation of the atomic dipoles, we reveal the anisotropic character of the onsite interaction and hopping dynamics and their influence on the superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum phase transition. Moreover, we observe nearest-neighbor interactions, a genuine consequence of the long-range nature of dipolar interactions. Our results lay the groundwork for future studies of exotic many-body quantum phases.

Here we develop a threshold theorem for quantum supremacy with noisy quantum circuits in the pre-threshold region, where quantum error correction does not work directly. We show that, even in such a region, we can virtually simulate quantum error correction by postselection. This allows us to show that the output sampled from the noisy quantum circuits (without postselection) cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computers based on a stable complexity theoretical conjecture, i.e., non-collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. By applying this to fault-tolerant quantum computation with the surface codes, we obtain the threshold value \$2.84{\textbackslash}\%\$ for quantum supremacy, which is much higher than the standard threshold \$0.75{\textbackslash}\%\$ for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with the same circuit-level noise model. Moreover, contrast to the standard noise threshold, the origin of quantum supremacy in noisy quantum circuits is quite clear; the threshold is determined purely by the threshold of magic state distillation, which is essential to gain a quantum advantage.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to outperform their classical counterparts in many applications. Rapid experimental progress in the last two decades includes the first demonstrations of small-scale quantum processors, but realising large-scale quantum information processors capable of universal quantum control remains a challenge. One primary obstacle is the inadequacy of classical computers for the task of optimising the experimental control field as we scale up to large systems. Classical optimisation procedures require a simulation of the quantum system and have a running time that grows exponentially with the number of quantum bits (qubits) in the system. Here we show that it is possible to tackle this problem by using the quantum processor to optimise its own control fields. Using measurement-based quantum feedback control (MQFC), we created a 12-coherence state with the essential control pulse completely designed by a 12-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. The results demonstrate the superiority of MQFC over classical optimisation methods, in both efficiency and accuracy. The time required for MQFC optimisation is linear in the number of qubits, and our 12-qubit system beat a classical computer configured with 2.4 GHz CPU and 8 GB memory. Furthermore, the fidelity of the MQFC-prepared 12-coherence was about 10\% better than the best result using classical optimisation, since the feedback approach inherently corrects for unknown imperfections in the quantum processor. As MQFC is readily transferrable to other technologies for universal quantum information processors, we anticipate that this result will open the way to scalably and precisely control quantum systems, bringing us closer to a demonstration of quantum supremacy.},

Important cases are situations in which one cannot classically calculate local expectation values of state preparations efficiently. In this work, we develop weak-membership formulations of the certification of ground state preparations. We provide a non-interactive protocol for certifying ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on simple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. This certification protocol can be applied to classically intractable analog quantum simulations: For example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can encode universal quantum computation in such ground states. Moreover, our certification protocol is applicable to ground state encodings of IQP circuits aiming at the demonstration of quantum supremacy. These can be certified efficiently when the error is polynomially bounded.},

After developing the fundamental concepts in quantum optics and quantum information theory, the book shows how optical systems can be used to build quantum computers according to the most recent ideas. It discusses implementations based on single photons and linear optics, optically controlled atoms and solid-state systems, atomic ensembles, and optical continuous variables. This book is ideal for graduate students beginning research in optical quantum information processing.

The choice of basis for later measurements may depend on earlier measurement outcomes and the final result of the computation is determined from the classical data of all the measurement outcomes. This is in contrast to the more familiar gate array model in which computational steps are unitary operations, developing a large entangled state prior to some final measurements for the output. Two principal schemes of measurement based computation are teleportation quantum computation (TQC) and the so-called cluster model or one-way quantum computer (1WQC). We will describe these schemes and show how they are able to perform universal quantum computation. We will outline various possible relationships between the models which serve to clarify their workings. We will also discuss possible novel computational benefits of the measurement based models compared to the gate array model, especially issues of parallelisability of algorithms.},

Here, we investigate how noise processes affecting physical states affect the performed computation by considering MBQC on a one-dimensional cluster state. This allows us to break down the computation in a sequence of building blocks and map physical errors to logical errors. Next, we extend the Matrix Product State construction to mixed states (which is known as Matrix Product Operators) and once again map the effect of physical noise to logical noise acting within the correlation space. This approach allows us to consider more general errors than the conventional Pauli errors, and could be used in order to simulate noisy quantum computation.},

This strategy was recently shown to achieve an approximate unitary \$2\$-design after a number of repetitions of the process, which implies that the strategy gradually achieves decoupling. Here, we prove that even fewer repetitions of the process suffice to achieve decoupling, showing that unitary \$2\$-designs with rather imprecise approximations can achieve decoupling at the same rate as that with the uniform ones. Based on this, we provide a simple quantum circuit achieving decoupling, which can be partitioned into a constant number of commuting parts and may have a practical merit, and a random many-body Hamiltonian, of which dynamics achieves decoupling in a constant time even if the system consists of a large number of particles. We also present applications of our decoupling theorem to coherent state merging and relative thermalisation.},

	abstract = {Unitary 2-designs are random unitaries simulating up to the second order statistical moments of the uniformly distributed random unitaries, often referred to as Haar random unitaries. They are used in a wide variety of theoretical and practical quantum information protocols, and also have been used to model the dynamics in complex quantum many-body systems. Here, we show that unitary 2-designs can be approximately implemented by alternately repeating random unitaries diagonal in the Pauli-\$Z\$ basis and that in the Pauli-\$X\$ basis. We also provide a converse about the number of repetitions needed to achieve unitary \$2\$-designs. These results imply that the process after \${\textbackslash}ell\$ repetitions achieves a \${\textbackslash}Theta(d{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}ell\})\$-approximate unitary 2-design. Based on the construction, we further provide quantum circuits that efficiently implement approximate unitary 2-designs. Although a more efficient implementation of unitary 2-designs is known, our quantum circuit has its own merit that it is divided into a constant number of commuting parts, which enables us to apply all commuting gates simultaneously and leads to a possible reduction of an actual execution time. We finally interpret the result in terms of the Hamiltonian dynamics and provide for the first time a random disordered Hamiltonian that realises a unitary \$2\$-design in a constant time even in many-body systems.},

We introduce a necessary and fair criterion for quantum error correction (QEC), which must be achieved in the development of these quantum processors before their sizes are sufficiently big to consider the well-known QEC threshold. We apply this criterion to benchmark the ongoing effort in implementing QEC with topological color codes using trapped-ion quantum processors and, more importantly, to guide the future hardware developments that shall be required in order to demonstrate beneficial QEC with small topological quantum codes. In doing so, we present a thorough description of a realistic trapped-ion toolbox for QEC, and a physically-motivated error model that goes beyond standard simplifications in the QEC literature. Our large-scale numerical analysis shows that two-species trapped-ion crystals in high-optical aperture segmented traps, with the improvements hereby described, are a very promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

Trapped atomic ions are among the physical systems in which building such a computing device seems viable. In this work we present a small-scale quantum information processor based on a string of 40 Ca + ions confined in a macroscopic linear Paul trap. We review our set of operations which includes non-coherent operations allowing us to realize arbitrary Markovian processes. In order to build a larger quantum information processor it is mandatory to reduce the error rate of the available operations which is only possible if the physics of the noise processes is well understood. We identify the dominant noise sources in our system and discuss their effects on different algorithms. Finally we demonstrate how our entire set of operations can be used to facilitate the implementation of algorithms by examples of the quantum Fourier transform and the quantum order finding algorithm.},

	abstract = {Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between the elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons. However, computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical computational methods. This has recently stimulated theoretical effort, using Feynman’s idea of a quantum simulator, to devise schemes for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realizing (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (the Schwinger model) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron–positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which can be directly and efficiently implemented on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle–antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum simulation of high-energy theories using atomic physics experiments—the long-term intention is to extend this approach to real-time quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.},

	abstract = {Random quantum circuits yield minimally structured models for chaotic quantum dynamics, able to capture for example universal properties of entanglement growth. We provide exact results and coarse-grained models for the spreading of operators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries. We study both 1+1D and higher dimensions, and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to operator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation, which gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC, and the butterfly speed \$v\_\{B\}\$. We find that in 1+1D the `front' of the OTOC broadens diffusively, with a width scaling in time as \$t{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$. We address fluctuations in the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that they are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front. Turning to higher D, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a remarkable correspondence with a classical droplet growth problem. This implies that the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as \$t{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}\$ in 2+1D and \$t{\textasciicircum}\{0.24\}\$ in 3+1D (KPZ exponents). We support our analytic argument with simulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in a lattice model, the late time shape of the spreading operator is in general not spherical. However when full spatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact asymptotic form for the OTOC in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an alternative perspective on the OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition function of an Ising-like model. Thanks to special structure arising from unitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which can be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for entanglement growth in 1+1D circuits.},

Following a method due to Weitz [15], we then use the equivalence between weak and strong spatial mixing to give a deterministic fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the partition function of the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model with arbitrary field on graphs of degree at most dd, throughout the uniqueness region of the Gibbs measure on the infinite dd-regular tree. By a standard correspondence, our results translate to arbitrary two-state anti-ferromagnetic spin systems with soft constraints. Subsequent to a preliminary version of this paper, Sly and Sun [13] have shown that our results are optimal in the sense that, under standard complexity theoretic assumptions, there does not exist a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the partition function of such spin systems on graphs of maximum degree dd for parameters outside the uniqueness region. Taken together, the results of [13] and of this paper therefore indicate a tight relationship between complexity theory and phase transition phenomena in two-state anti-ferromagnetic spin systems.},

	abstract = {The class of two-spin systems contains several important models, including random independent sets and the Ising model of statistical physics. We show that for both the hard-core (independent set) model and the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model with arbitrary external field, it is NP-hard to approximate the partition function or approximately sample from the model on d-regular graphs when the model has non-uniqueness on the d-regular tree. Together with results of Jerrum--Sinclair, Weitz, and Sinclair--Srivastava--Thurley giving FPRAS's for all other two-spin systems except at the uniqueness threshold, this gives an almost complete classification of the computational complexity of two-spin systems on bounded-degree graphs. Our proof establishes that the normalized log-partition function of any two-spin system on bipartite locally tree-like graphs converges to a limiting "free energy density" which coincides with the (non-rigorous) Bethe prediction of statistical physics. We use this result to characterize the local structure of two-spin systems on locally tree-like bipartite expander graphs, which then become the basic gadgets in a randomized reduction to approximate MAX-CUT. Our approach is novel in that it makes no use of the second moment method employed in previous works on these questions.},

In this paper, we consider time evolution by Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) Hamiltonians and analytically compute out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) and frame potentials to quantify scrambling, Haar-randomness, and circuit complexity. While our random matrix analysis gives a qualitatively correct prediction of the late-time behavior of chaotic systems, we find unphysical behavior at early times including an \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(1)\$ scrambling time and the apparent breakdown of spatial and temporal locality. The salient feature of GUE Hamiltonians which gives us computational traction is the Haar-invariance of the ensemble, meaning that the ensemble-averaged dynamics look the same in any basis. Motivated by this property of the GUE, we introduce \$k\$-invariance as a precise definition of what it means for the dynamics of a quantum system to be described by random matrix theory. We envision that the dynamical onset of approximate \$k\$-invariance will be a useful tool for capturing the transition from early-time chaos, as seen by OTOCs, to late-time chaos, as seen by random matrix theory.},

	abstract = {Approximate counting via correlation decay is the core algorithmic technique used in the sharp delineation of the computational phase transition that arises in the approximation of the partition function of anti-ferromagnetic two-spin models. Previous analyses of correlation-decay algorithms implicitly depended on the occurrence of strong spatial mixing (SSM). This means that one uses worst-case analysis of the recursive procedure that creates the sub-instances. We develop a new analysis method that is more refined than the worst-case analysis. We take the shape of instances in the computation tree into consideration and amortise against certain "bad" instances that are created as the recursion proceeds. This enables us to show correlation decay and to obtain an FPTAS even when SSM fails. We apply our technique to the problem of approximately counting independent sets in hypergraphs with degree upper-bound Delta and with a lower bound k on the arity of hyperedges. Liu and Lin gave an FPTAS for k{\textgreater}=2 and Delta{\textless}=5 (lack of SSM was the obstacle preventing this algorithm from being generalised to Delta=6). Our technique gives a tight result for Delta=6, showing that there is an FPTAS for k{\textgreater}=3 and Delta{\textless}=6. The best previously-known approximation scheme for Delta=6 is the Markov-chain simulation based FPRAS of Bordewich, Dyer and Karpinski, which only works for k{\textgreater}=8. Our technique also applies for larger values of k, giving an FPTAS for k{\textgreater}=Delta. This bound is not substantially stronger than existing randomised results in the literature. Nevertheless, it gives the first deterministic approximation scheme in this regime. Moreover, unlike existing results, it leads to an FPTAS for counting dominating sets in regular graphs with sufficiently large degree. We further demonstrate that approximately counting independent sets in hypergraphs is NP-hard even within the uniqueness regime.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08913},
	abstract = {Although the emergence of a fully-functional quantum computer may still be far away from today, in the near future, it is possible to have medium-size, special-purpose, quantum devices that can perform computational tasks not efficiently simulable with any classical computer. This status is known as quantum supremacy (or quantum advantage), where one of the promising approaches is through the sampling of chaotic quantum circuits. Sampling of ideal chaotic quantum circuits has been argued to require an exponential time for classical devices. A major question is whether quantum supremacy can be maintained under noise without error correction, as the implementation of fault-tolerance would cost lots of extra qubits and quantum gates. Here we show that, for a family of chaotic quantum circuits subject to Pauli errors, there exists an non-exponential classical algorithm capable of simulating the noisy chaotic quantum circuits with bounded errors. This result represents a serious challenge to a previous result in the literature suggesting the failure of classical devices in simulating noisy chaotic circuits with about 48 qubits and depth 25. Moreover, even though our model does not cover all types of experimental errors, from a practical point view, our result describes a well-defined setting where quantum supremacy can be tested against the challenges of classical rivals, in the context of chaotic quantum circuits.},

Merely Gaussian measurements such as optical homodyning as well as photon counting measurements are required, on individual sites. These schemes overcome limitations posed by Gaussian cluster states, which are known not to be universal for quantum computations of unbounded length, unless one is willing to scale the degree of squeezing with the total system size. We establish a framework derived from tensor networks and matrix product states with infinite physical dimension and finite auxiliary dimension general enough to provide a framework for such schemes. Since in the discussed schemes the logical encoding is finite-dimensional, tools of error correction are applicable. We also identify some further limitations for any continuous-variable computing scheme from which one can argue that no substantially easier ways of continuous-variable measurement-based computing than the presented one can exist.},

Using a framework of Gaussian projected entangled pair states (GPEPS), we show that no matter what Gaussian local measurements are performed on systems distributed on a general graph, transport and processing of quantum information is not possible beyond a certain influence region, except for exponentially suppressed corrections. We also demonstrate that even under arbitrary non-Gaussian local measurements, slabs of Gaussian cluster states of a finite width cannot carry logical quantum information, even if sophisticated encodings of qubits in continuous-variable (CV) systems are allowed for. This is proven by suitably contracting tensor networks representing infinite-dimensional quantum systems. The result can be seen as sharpening the requirements for quantum error correction and fault tolerance for Gaussian cluster states, and points towards the necessity of non-Gaussian resource states for measurement-based quantum computing. The results can equally be viewed as referring to Gaussian quantum repeater networks.},

	abstract = {The theme of this paper is to investigate to what extent approximation, possibly together with randomization, can reduce the complexity of problems in Valiant’s class \# P. In general, any function in \# P can be approximated to within any constant factor by a function in the class \${\textbackslash}Delta \_3{\textasciicircum}p \$ of the polynomial-time, hierarchy. Relative to a particular oracle, \${\textbackslash}Delta \_3{\textasciicircum}p \$ cannot be replaced by \${\textbackslash}Delta \_2{\textasciicircum}p \$ in this result. Another part of the paper introduces a model of random sampling where the size of a set X is estimated by checking, for various “sample sets” S, whether or not S intersects X For various classes of sample sets, upper and lower bounds on the number of samples required to estimate the size of X are discussed. This type of sampling is motivated by particular problems in \# P such as computing the size of a backtrack search tree. In the case of backtrack search trees, a sample amounts to checking whether a certain path exists in the tree. One of the lower bounds suggests that such tests alone are not sufficient to give a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for this problem, even if the algorithm can randomize.},

We address the proof of hardness for the exact probability distribution of these quantum circuits by exploiting mappings onto different architectures of sub-universal quantum computers. We obtain both a worst-case and an average-case hardness result. Hardness of Boson Sampling with eight-port homodyne detection is obtained as the zero squeezing limit of our model.

	abstract = {Quantum systems, in general, output data that cannot be simulated efficiently by a classical computer, and hence is useful for solving certain mathematical problems and simulating quantum many-body systems. This also implies, unfortunately, that verification of the output of the quantum systems is not so trivial, since predicting the output is exponentially hard. As another problem, quantum system is very delicate for noise and thus needs error correction. Here we propose a framework for verification of the output of fault-tolerant quantum computation in the measurement-based model. Contrast to existing analyses on fault-tolerance, we do not assume any noise model on the resource state, but an arbitrary resource state is tested by using only single-qubit measurements to verify whether the output of measurement-based quantum computation on it is correct or not. The overhead for verification including classical processing is linear in the size of quantum computation. Since full characterization of quantum noise is exponentially hard for large-scale quantum computing systems, our framework provides an efficient way of practical verification of experimental quantum error correction. Moreover, the proposed verification scheme is also compatible to measurement-only blind quantum computation, where a client can accept the delegated quantum computation even when a quantum sever makes deviation, as long as the output is correct.},

	abstract = {A well-known result of Gottesman and Knill states that Clifford circuits - i.e. circuits composed of only CNOT, Hadamard, and \${\textbackslash}pi/4\$ phase gates - are efficiently classically simulable. We show that in contrast, "conjugated Clifford circuits" (CCCs) - where one additionally conjugates every qubit by the same one-qubit gate U - can perform hard sampling tasks. In particular, we fully classify the computational power of CCCs by showing that essentially any non-Clifford conjugating unitary U can give rise to sampling tasks which cannot be simulated classically to constant multiplicative error, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Furthermore, we show that this hardness result can be extended to allow for the more realistic model of constant additive error, under a plausible complexity-theoretic conjecture.},

Our results hold when it is possible to prepare single-qubit states in an ideal and noise-free way, while gates and measurements are error-prone and imperfect. Alternatively, they also hold when it is possible to perform measurements in a discrete set of bases in an ideal way, whereas state preparation and gates are imperfect. Our technique is different from existing trap based approaches and offers unique advantages. As an example, it reduces the types of single-qubit states that need to be prepared in an ideal way, or alternatively the number of bases for ideal measurements.},

We show that if only near-perfect security is required, the size of the key can be reduced by a factor of two. More specifically, we show that there exists a set of roughly d log d unitary operators whose average effect on every input pure state is almost perfectly randomizing, as compared to the d2 operators required to randomize perfectly. Aside from the private quantum channel, variations of this construction can be applied to many other tasks in quantum information processing. We show, for instance, that it can be used to construct LOCC data hiding schemes for bits and qubits that are much more efficient than any others known, allowing roughly log d qubits to be hidden in 2 log d qubits. The method can also be used to exhibit the existence of quantum states with locked classical correlations, an arbitrarily large amplification of the correlation being accomplished by sending a negligibly small classical key. Our construction also provides the basic building block for a method of remotely preparing arbitrary d-dimensional pure quantum states using approximately log d bits of communication and log d ebits of entanglement.},

Recently, boson sampling has emerged as a problem that is suspected to be intractable on any classical computer, but efficiently implementable with a linear quantum optical setup. Therefore, boson sampling may offer an experimentally realizable challenge to the Extended Church-Turing thesis and this remarkable possibility motivated much of the interest around boson sampling, at least in relation to complexity-theoretic questions. In this work, we show that the successful development of a boson sampling apparatus would not only answer such inquiries, but also yield a practical tool for difficult molecular computations. Specifically, we show that a boson sampling device with a modified input state can be used to generate molecular vibronic spectra, including complicated effects such as Duschinsky rotations.},

	abstract = {Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems is notoriously hard on classical computers. An alternative approach, as proposed by Feynman, is to use a quantum computer. Here, we discuss quantum simulation of strongly correlated fermionic systems. We focus specifically on 2D and linear geometry with nearest neighbor qubit-qubit couplings, typical for superconducting transmon qubit arrays. We improve an existing algorithm to prepare an arbitrary Slater determinant by exploiting a unitary symmetry. We also present a quantum algorithm to prepare an arbitrary fermionic Gaussian state with \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ gates and \$O(N)\$ circuit depth. Both algorithms are optimal in the sense that the numbers of parameters in the quantum circuits are equal to those to describe the quantum states. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to implement the 2-dimensional (2D) fermionic Fourier transformation on a 2D qubit array with only \$O(N{\textasciicircum}\{1.5\})\$ gates and \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt N)\$ circuit depth, which is the minimum depth required for quantum information to travel across the qubit array. We also present methods to simulate each time step in the evolution of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model---again on a 2D qubit array---with \$O(N)\$ gates and \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt N)\$ circuit depth. Finally, we discuss how these algorithms can be used to determine the ground state properties and phase diagrams of strongly correlated quantum systems using the Hubbard model as an example.},

But the question of the exact nature of the power contributed by quantum mechanics remains only partially answered. Furthermore, there exists doubt over the practicality of achieving a large enough quantum computation that definitively demonstrates quantum supremacy. Recently the study of computational problems that produce samples from probability distributions has added to both our understanding of the power of quantum algorithms and lowered the requirements for demonstration of fast quantum algorithms. The proposed quantum sampling problems do not require a quantum computer capable of universal operations and also permit physically realistic errors in their operation. This is an encouraging step towards an experimental demonstration of quantum algorithmic supremacy. In this paper, we will review sampling problems and the arguments that have been used to deduce when sampling problems are hard for classical computers to simulate. Two classes of quantum sampling problems that demonstrate the supremacy of quantum algorithms are BosonSampling and Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time Sampling. We will present the details of these classes and recent experimental progress towards demonstrating quantum supremacy in BosonSampling.},

	abstract = {We show that there are two distinct aspects of a general quantum circuit that can make it hard to efficiently simulate with a classical computer. The first aspect, which has been well-studied, is that it can be hard to efficiently estimate the probability associated with a particular measurement outcome. However, we show that this aspect alone does not determine whether a quantum circuit can be efficiently simulated. The second aspect is that, in general, there can be an exponential number of `relevant' outcomes that are needed for an accurate simulation, and so efficient simulation may not be possible even in situations where the probabilities of individual outcomes can be efficiently estimated. We show that these two aspects are distinct, the former being necessary but not sufficient for simulability whilst the pair is jointly sufficient for simulability. Specifically, we prove that a family of quantum circuits is efficiently simulable if it satisfies two properties: one related to the efficiency of Born rule probability estimation, and the other related to the sparsity of the outcome distribution. We then prove a pair of hardness results (using standard complexity assumptions and a variant of a commonly-used average case hardness conjecture), where we identify families of quantum circuits that satisfy one property but not the other, and for which efficient simulation is not possible. To prove our results, we consider a notion of simulation of quantum circuits that we call epsilon-simulation. This notion is less stringent than exact sampling and is now in common use in quantum hardness proofs.},

	abstract = {It is a long-standing open problem whether quantum computing can be verified by a classical verifier. In the computational complexity term, it is "Does any BQP problem have an interactive proof system with a BQP prover and a BPP verifier?". Several partial solutions to the open problem have been obtained. For example, verifiable blind quantum computing protocols demonstrate that if the verifier is slightly quantum, the problem is solved. Furthermore, the answer to the open problem is yes for specific BQP problems, such as the recursive Fourier sampling. In this paper, we consider a problem of distinguishing output probability distributions of two quantum circuits. We show that the problem is BQP-complete, but if the two circuits are restricted to some circuits in the second level of the Fourier hierarchy, such as IQP circuits, the problem has a Merlin-Arthur proof system where the prover (Merlin) has the power of BQP for yes instances. Our result is therefore another example of specific BQP problems that have an interactive proof system with a BQP prover and a BPP verifier. As an additional result, we also consider a simple model in the second level of the Fourier hierarchy, and show that a multiplicative-error classical efficient sampling of the output probability distribution of the model causes the collapse of the polynomial-time hierarchy to the third or the second level. The model consists of a classical reversible circuit sandwiched by two layers of Hadamard gates. The proof technique for its quantum supremacy is different from those for previous sub-universal models, such as IQP, Boson Sampling, and DQC1, and therefore the technique itself might be useful for other applications.},

Here we establish a computational quantum-classical boundary from the viewpoint of classical simulatability of a quantum system under decoherence. Specifically, we consider commuting quantum circuits being subject to decoherence. Or equivalently, we can regard them as measurement-based quantum computation on decohered weighted graph states. To show intractability of classical simulation in the quantum side, we utilize the postselection argument and crucially strengthen it by taking noise effect into account. Classical simulatability in the classical side is also shown constructively by using both separable criteria in a projected-entangled-pair-state picture and the Gottesman-Knill theorem for mixed state Clifford circuits. We found that when each qubit is subject to a single-qubit complete-positive-trace-preserving noise, the computational quantum-classical boundary is sharply given by the noise rate required for the distillability of a magic state. The obtained quantum-classical boundary of noisy quantum dynamics reveals a complexity landscape of controlled quantum systems. This paves a way to an experimentally feasible verification of quantum mechanics in a high complexity limit beyond classically simulatable region.},

The question touches on fundamental issues regarding probability, physics, and computability, as well as on exciting problems in experimental physics, engineering, computer science, and mathematics. We propose three related directions towards a negative answer. The first is a conjecture about physical realizations of quantum codes, the second has to do with correlations in stochastic physical systems, and the third proposes a model for quantum evolutions when noise accumulates. The paper is dedicated to the memory of Itamar Pitowsky.},

	abstract = {The complexity of the commuting local Hamiltonians (CLH) problem still remains a mystery after two decades of research of quantum Hamiltonian complexity; it is only known to be contained in NP for few low parameters. Of particular interest is the tightly related question of understanding whether groundstates of CLHs can be generated by efficient quantum circuits. The two problems touch upon conceptual, physical and computational questions, including the centrality of non-commutation in quantum mechanics, quantum PCP and the area law. It is natural to try to address first the more physical case of CLHs embedded on a 2D lattice but this problem too remained open, apart from some very specific cases. Here we consider a wide class of two dimensional CLH instances; these are \$k\$-local CLHs, for any constant \$k\$; they are defined on qubits set on the edges of any surface complex, where we require that this surface complex is not too far from being "Euclidean". Each vertex and each face can be associated with an arbitrary term (as long as the terms commute). We show that this class is in NP, and moreover that the groundstates have an efficient quantum circuit that prepares them. This result subsumes that of Schuch [2011] which regarded the special case of \$4\$-local Hamiltonians on a grid with qubits, and by that it removes the mysterious feature of Schuch's proof which showed containment in NP without providing a quantum circuit for the groundstate and considerably generalizes it. We believe this work and the tools we develop make a significant step towards showing that 2D CLHs are in NP.},

	abstract = {We study the complexity of classically sampling from the output distribution of an Ising spin model, which can be implemented naturally in a variety of atomic, molecular, and optical systems. In particular, we construct a specific example of an Ising Hamiltonian that, after time evolution starting from a trivial initial state, produces a particular output configuration with probability very nearly proportional to the square of the permanent of a matrix with arbitrary integer entries. In a similar spirit to boson sampling, the ability to sample classically from the probability distribution induced by time evolution under this Hamiltonian would imply unlikely complexity theoretic consequences, suggesting that the dynamics of such a spin model cannot be efficiently simulated with a classical computer. Physical Ising spin systems capable of achieving problem-size instances (i.e., qubit numbers) large enough so that classical sampling of the output distribution is classically difficult in practice may be achievable in the near future. Unlike boson sampling, our current results only imply hardness of exact classical sampling, leaving open the important question of whether a much stronger approximate-sampling hardness result holds in this context. The latter is most likely necessary to enable a convincing experimental demonstration of quantum supremacy. As referenced in a recent paper [A. Bouland, L. Mancinska, and X. Zhang, in Proceedings of the 31st Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC 2016), Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik, Dagstuhl, 2016)], our result completes the sampling hardness classification of two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09954},
	abstract = {Quantum computation provides exponential speedup for solving certain mathematical problems against classical computers. Motivated by current rapid experimental progress on quantum computing devices, various models of quantum computation have been investigated to show quantum computational supremacy. At a commercial side, quantum annealing machine realizes the quantum Ising model with a transverse field and heuristically solves combinatorial optimization problems. The computational power of this machine is closely related to adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) with a restricted type of Hamiltonians, namely stoquastic Hamiltonians, and has been thought to be relatively less powerful compared to universal quantum computers. Little is known about computational quantum speedup nor advantage in AQC with stoquastic Hamiltonians. Here we characterize computational capability of AQC with stoquastic Hamiltonians, which we call stoqAQC. We construct a concrete stoqAQC model, whose lowest energy gap is lower bounded polynomially, and hence the final state can be obtained in polynomial time. Then we show that it can simulate universal quantum computation if adaptive single-qubit measurements in non-standard bases are allowed on the final state. Even if the measurements are restricted to non-adaptive measurements to respect the robustness of AQC, the proposed model exhibits quantum computational supremacy; classical simulation is impossible under complexity theoretical conjectures. Moreover, it is found that such a stoqAQC model can simulate Shor's algorithm and solve the factoring problem in polynomial time. We also propose how to overcome the measurement imperfections via quantum error correction within the stoqAQC model and also an experimentally feasible verification scheme to test whether or not stoqAQC is done faithfully.},

In this work, we show that one can devise versatile and feasible schemes of two-dimensional, dynamical, quantum simulators showing such a quantum speedup, building on intermediate problems involving nonadaptive, measurement-based, quantum computation. In each of the schemes, an initial product state is prepared, potentially involving an element of randomness as in disordered models, followed by a short-time evolution under a basic translationally invariant Hamiltonian with simple nearest-neighbor interactions and a mere sampling measurement in a fixed basis. The correctness of the final-state preparation in each scheme is fully efficiently certifiable. We discuss experimental necessities and possible physical architectures, inspired by platforms of cold atoms in optical lattices and a number of others, as well as specific assumptions that enter the complexity-theoretic arguments. This work shows that benchmark settings exhibiting a quantum speedup may require little control, in contrast to universal quantum computing. Thus, our proposal puts a convincing experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup within reach in the near term.},

The new basis consists of two single-qubit gates (Hadamard and σz¼) and one double-qubit gate (Controlled-NOT). Since the set consisting of Controlled-NOT and Hadamard gates is not universal, the new basis achieves universality by including only one additional elementary (in the sense that it does not include angles that are irrational multiples of π) single-qubit gate, and hence, is potentially the simplest universal basis that one can construct.

One of the main difficulties in realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer making long computations impossible. A further difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering long computations unreliable. However, these obstacles may not be as formidable as originally believed. For any quantum computation with t gates, we show how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that tolerates O(1/logct) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c; the previous bound was O(1/t). We do this by showing that operations can be performed on quantum data encoded by quantum error-correcting codes without decoding this data},

abstract = {Suppose we are given a matrix that is formed by adding an unknown sparse matrix to an unknown low-rank matrix. Our goal is to decompose the given matrix into its sparse and low-rank components. Such a problem arises in a number of applications in model and system identification and is intractable to solve in general. In this paper we consider a convex optimization formulation to splitting the specified matrix into its components by minimizing a linear combination of the l1-norm and the nuclear norm of the components. We develop a notion of rank-sparsity incoherence, expressed as an uncertainty principle between the sparsity pattern of a matrix and its row and column spaces, and we use it to characterize both fundamental identifiability as well as (deterministic) sufficient conditions for exact recovery. Our analysis is geometric in nature with the tangent spaces to the algebraic varieties of sparse and low-rank matrices playing a prominent role. When the sparse and low-rank matrices are drawn from certain natural random ensembles, we show that the sufficient conditions for exact recovery are satisfied with high probability. We conclude with simulation results on synthetic matrix decomposition problems.},

@article{Davenport2011,
abstract = {In recent years, compressed sensing (CS) has attracted considerable attention in areas of applied mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering by suggesting that it may be possible to surpass the traditional limits of sampling theory. CS builds upon the fundamental fact that we can represent many signals using only a few non-zero coecients in a suitable basis or dictionary. Nonlinear optimization can then enable recovery of such signals from very few measurements. In this chapter, we provide an up-to-date review of the basic theory underlying CS. After a brief historical overview, we begin with a discussion of sparsity and other low dimensional signal models. We then treat the central question of how to accurately recover a high-dimensional signal from a small set of measurements and provide performance guarantees for a variety of sparse recovery algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of some extensions of the sparse recovery framework. In subsequent chapters of the book, we will see how the fundamentals presented in this chapter are extended in many exciting directions, including new models for describing structure in both analog and discrete-time signals, new sensing design techniques, more advanced recovery results, and emerging applications.},

abstract = {The book offers a direct and up-to-date introduction to the theory of one-parameter semigroups of linear operators on Banach spaces.{\~{}} It contains the fundamental results of the theory such as the Hille-Yoshida generation theorem, the bounded perturbation theorem, and the Trotter-Kato approximation theorem, but also treats the spectral theory of semigroups and its consequences for the qualitative behavior. The book is intended for students and researchers who want to become acquainted with the concept of semigroups in order to work with it in fields like partial and functional differential equations, stochastic processes, infinite dimensional control theory, or dynamical systems coming from physics or biology.},

abstract = {Molecular characterization of rhizobacterial isolate RM-3, based on sequencing of a partial 1,313-bp fragment of 16S rDNA amplicon, validated the strain as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The strain showed significant growth inhibition of different phytopathogenic fungi in dual plate and liquid culture assays. Maximum growth inhibition was found in case of Macrophomina phaseolina in plate assay (68{\%}), whereas it was 93{\%} in Dreschlera graminae in dual liquid assay. Microscopic studies (light and scanning electron) showed morphological abnormalities such as perforation, fragmentation, swelling, shriveling and lysis of hyphae of pathogenic fungi. The strain also exhibited production of siderophore and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on chrome azurol S and King's B media, respectively. Besides, this strain also produced extracellular chitinase enzyme and an important antibiotic, phenazine. Seed bacterization with RM-3 showed a significant (P {\textless} 0.05) increase in seed germination, shoot length, shoot fresh and dry weight, root length, root fresh and dry weight and leaf area. It was also able to colonize the rhizosphere of plants and reduced percent disease incidence in M. phaseolina-infested soil by 83{\%}. Yield parameters such as pods, number of seeds and grain yield per plant also enhanced significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) in comparison to control. Thus, the secondary metabolites producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain RM-3 exhibited innate potential of plant growth promotion and biocontrol potential in vitro and in vivo.},

@book{RMT2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@book{Fallis2013e,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@book{Jahromi2014,
abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

abstract = {Gabor frames for signals over finite Abelian groups, generated by an arbitrary lattice within the finite time-frequency plane, are the central topic of this paper. Our generic approach covers both multi-dimensional signals as well as non-separable lattices, and in fact the multi-window case as well. Our generic approach includes most of the fundamental facts about Gabor expansions of finite signals for the case of product lattices, as they have been given by Qiu, Wexler-Raz or Tolimieri-Orr, Bastiaans and Van-Leest and others. In our presentation the spreading representation of linear operators between finite-dimensional Hilbert space as well as a symplectic version of Poisson's summation formula over the finite time-frequency plane are essential ingredients. They bring us to the so-called Fundamental Identity of Gabor Analysis. In addition, we highlight projective representations of the time-frequency plane and its subgroups and explain the natural connection to twisted group algebras. In the finite-dimensional setting discussed in this paper these twisted group algebras are just matrix algebras and their structure provides the algebraic framework for the study of the deeper properties of finite-dimensional Gabor frames, independent of the structure theory theorem for finite Abelian groups. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A geometric perspective involving Grammian and frame operators is used to derive the entire family of Welch bounds. This perspective unifies a number of observations that have been made regarding tightness of the bounds and their connections to symmetric k-tensors, tight frames, homogeneous polynomials, and t-designs. In particular, a connection has been drawn between sampling of homogeneous polynomials and frames of symmetric k-tensors. It is also shown that tightness of the bounds requires tight frames. The lack of tight frames of symmetric k-tensors in many cases, however, leads to consideration of sets that come as close as possible to attaining the bounds. The geometric derivation is then extended in the setting of generalized or continuous frames. The Welch bounds for finite sets and countably infinite sets become special cases of this general setting. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article surveys some developments in pure mathematics which have, to varying degrees, grown out of the ideas of gauge theory in Mathematical Physics. The realisation that the gauge fields of particle physics and the connections of differential geometry are one and the same has had wide-ranging consequences, at different levels. Most directly, it has lead mathematicians to work on new kinds of questions, often shedding light later on well-established problems. Less directly, various fundamental ideas and techniques, notably the need to work with the infinite-dimensional gauge symmetry group, have found a place in the general world-view of many mathematicians, influencing developments in other fields. Still less direct, the work in this area—between geometry and mathematical physics—has been a prime example of the interaction between these fields which has been so fruitful over the past thirty years. The body of this paper is divided into three sections: roughly corresponding to Analysis, Geometry and Topology. However the different topics come together in many different ways: indeed the existence of these links between the topics is one the most attractive features of the area.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Speech production involves the generation of an auditory signal from the articulators and vocal tract. When the intended auditory signal does not match the produced sounds, subsequent articulatory commands can be adjusted to reduce the difference between the intended and produced sounds. This requires an internal model of the intended speech output that can be compared to the produced speech. The aim of this functional imaging study was to identify brain activation related to the internal model of speech production after activation related to vocalization, auditory feedback, and movement in the articulators had been controlled. There were four conditions: silent articulation of speech, non-speech mouth movements, finger tapping, and visual fixation. In the speech conditions, participants produced the mouth movements associated with the words "one" and "three." We eliminated auditory feedback from the spoken output by instructing participants to articulate these words without producing any sound. The non-speech mouth movement conditions involved lip pursing and tongue protrusions to control for movement in the articulators. The main difference between our speech and non-speech mouth movement conditions is that prior experience producing speech sounds leads to the automatic and covert generation of auditory and phonological associations that may play a role in predicting auditory feedback. We found that, relative to non-speech mouth movements, silent speech activated Broca's area in the left dorsal pars opercularis and Wernicke's area in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus. We discuss these results in the context of a generative model of speech production and propose that Broca's and Wernicke's areas may be involved in predicting the speech output that follows articulation. These predictions could provide a mechanism by which rapid movement of the articulators is precisely matched to the intended speech outputs during future articulations.},

abstract = {This paper presents the capacity region of frequency-selective Gaussian interference channels under the condition of strong interference, assuming an average power constraint per user. First, a frequency-selective Gaussian interference channel is modeled as a set of independent parallel memoryless Gaussian interference channels. Using nonfrequency selective results, the capacity region of frequency-selective Gaussian interference channels under strong interference is expressed mathematically. Exploiting structures inherent in the problem, a dual problem is constructed for each independent memoryless channel, in which both mathematical and numerical analysis are performed. Furthermore, three suboptimal methods are compared to the capacity-achieving coding and power allocation scheme. Iterative waterfilling, a suboptimal scheme, provides close-to-optimum performance and has a distributed coding and power allocation scheme, which are attractive in practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of instructor feedback and video tutorials on skill acquisition during proficiency-based laparoscopic suturing training. METHODS: Performance data from a prospectively maintained database were reviewed for three groups of novices (n = 34 medical students) who completed the same proficiency-based laparoscopic suturing curriculum on a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery-type videotrainer model as part of two separate institutional review board-approved, randomized controlled trials. Group I (n = 9) watched the video tutorial once and received intense feedback during each training session; Group II (n = 13) watched the video tutorial once and received limited feedback ({\textless}10 min per session); Group III (n = 12) watched the video tutorial several times and also received limited feedback ({\textless}10 min per session). Feedback was given by the same instructor and was quantified on a 0 (none) to 4 (extensive) Likert scale. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar for all groups. All participants achieved the proficiency level (512) on two consecutive attempts. Group III required the shortest training time and number of repetitions to reach proficiency, with statistically significant differences compared with Group I (P {\textless} 0.02). This strategy led to a cost savings of {\$}139 per trainee. CONCLUSIONS: Limited instructor feedback appears to be superior to intense feedback during proficiency-based laparoscopic simulator training. Coupled with video tutorials, this type of feedback may accelerate learning and improve resource utilization by minimizing the need for instructor involvement.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent systematic review, practice guidelines, and consensus statements have summarized the known clinical trial information with regards to the appropriate use of external-beam radiation, brachytherapy, and concurrent chemotherapy (with external-beam radiotherapy) in the palliation of chest symptoms with thoracic radiotherapy. The purpose of this review is to describe our present knowledge with regards to palliative thoracic radiotherapeutic maneuvers and to identify potential areas for future research inquiry consistent with current knowledge gaps. RECENT FINDINGS: Two systematic reviews, one practice guideline, and one consensus statement based on published prospective clinical trials have demonstrated that palliative thoracic radiotherapy is an effective modality both in terms of symptom palliation and other important cancer outcomes. Evolving areas for future scientific inquiry include the role of advanced technologies such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy and image-guided radiation therapy, economic analyses as well as the creation of a common palliative endpoint that can be used for future clinical trials. SUMMARY: Robust clinical trial information and high-level knowledge-translation documents currently exist to guide radiotherapy practitioners to provide standard-of-care treatment for thoracic palliative scenarios.},

abstract = {The channel model assumed is a linear, time-invariant filter followed by additive, colored Gaussian noise. A general problem formulation is introduced which involves use of this channel once for T seconds to communicate one of M signals. Two questions are considered: (1) given a set of signals, what is the probability of error. and (2) how should these signals be selected to minimize the probability of error. It is shown that answers to these questions are possible when a suitable vector space representation is used, and the basis functions required for this representation are presented. Using this representation and the random coding technique, a bound on the probability of error for a random ensemble of signals is determined and the structure of the ensemble of signals yielding a minimum error bound is derived. The interrelation of coding and modulation in this analysis is discussed and it is concluded that: (1) the optimum ensemble of signals involves an impractical modulation technique, and (2) the error bound for the optimum ensemble of signals provides a 'best possible' result against which more practical modulation techniques may be compared.},

abstract = {For high-frequency fields, which can be separated into superpositions of a few distinct components with rapidly varying phases and slowly varying amplitudes, phase-space representations exhibit a strong localisation in which the coefficients are negligible over most of the phase space. This leads, potentially, to a very large reduction in the computational cost of computing propagators. Using the Windowed Fourier Transform, a number of fundamental problems from diffraction theory are studied using a representation of continuous wavefields by superpositions of beams that are continuously parameterised in phasespace and which propagate along ray trajectories. The existence of noncanonical WFT coefficients is observed, due to the nonuniqeness of the WFT. Numerical evaluations require discrete finite bases. The discrete Wilson basis is generated by a discrete sampling of the windowed Fourier Transform in the phase-space. The sampling is optimal, in the sense that the smallest number of coefficients is generated in an orthogonal basis.},

@article{Schiff1999,
abstract = {The Laplace transform is an extremely versatile technique for solving differential equations, both ordinary and partial. It can also be used to solve difference equations. The present text, while mathematically rigorous, is readily accessible to students of either mathematics or engineering. Even the Dirac delta function, which is normally covered in a heuristic fashion, is given a completely justifiable treatment in the context of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, yet at a level an undergraduate student can appreciate. When it comes to the deepest part of the theory, the Complex Inversion Formula, a knowledge of poles, residues, and contour integration of meromorphic functions is required. To this end, an entire chapter is devoted to the fundamentals of complex analysis. In addition to all the theoretical considerations, there are numerous worked examples drawn from engineering and physics.When applying the Laplace transform, it is important to have a good understanding of the theory underlying it, rather than just a cursory knowledge of its application. This text provides that understanding.},

@article{Fickus2014,
abstract = {In many applications, signals are measured according to a linear process, but the phases of these measurements are often unreliable or not available. To reconstruct the signal, one must perform a process known as phase retrieval. This paper focuses on completely determining signals with as few intensity measurements as possible, and on efficient phase retrieval algorithms from such measurements. For the case of complex M-dimensional signals, we construct a measurement ensemble of size 4M-4 which yields injective intensity measurements; this is conjectured to be the smallest such ensemble. For the case of real signals, we devise a theory of "almost" injective intensity measurements, and we characterize such ensembles. Later, we show that phase retrieval from M+1 almost injective intensity measurements is NP-hard, indicating that computationally efficient phase retrieval must come at the price of measurement redundancy. ??

abstract = {In a variety of fields, in particular those involving imaging and optics, we often measure signals whose phase is missing or has been irremediably distorted. Phase retrieval attempts the recovery of the phase information from the magnitude of the Fourier transform. Under which conditions the signal of interest can be uniquely recovered from the measured magnitudes? In this paper, we assume the measured signal to be sparse. This is a natural assumption in many applications, like X-ray crystallography, speckle imaging and blind channel estimation. Then, we derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the solution of the phase retrieval (PR) problem for both discrete and continuous domains, and for one and multi--dimensional domains. More precisely, we prove that the solution is almost surely unique (unique) on 1--dimensional (multi--dimensional) domains when the signal's support satisfies specific conditions.},

@article{DAspremont2007,
abstract = {Given a covariance matrix, we consider the problem of maximizing the variance explained by a particular linear combination of the input variables while constraining the number of nonzero coefficients in this combination. This problem arises in the decomposition of a covariance matrix into sparse factors or sparse principal component analysis (PCA), and has wide applications ranging from biology to finance. We use a modification of the classical variational representation of the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix, where cardinality is constrained, and derive a semidefinite programming–based relaxation for our problem. We also discuss Nesterov's smooth minimization technique applied to the semidefinite program arising in the semidefinite relaxation of the sparse PCA problem. The method has complexity {\$}O(n{\^{}}4 \backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashlog(n){\}}/\backslashepsilon){\$}, where n is the size of the underlying covariance matrix and {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is the desired absolute accuracy on the optimal value of the problem.

We also make an extension to channels with continuous alphabet. As an application we prove the formula for the capacity of the quantum Gaussian channel with constrained energy of the signal, establishing the asymptotic equivalence of this channel to the semiclassical photon channel. We also study the lower bounds for the reliability function of the pure-state Gaussian channel.},

abstract = {Weyl's displacement operators for position and momentum commute if the product of the elementary displacements equals Planck's constant. Then, their common eigenstates constitute the Zak basis, each state specified by two phase parameters. Upon enforcing a periodic dependence on the phases, one gets a one-to-one mapping of the Hilbert space on the line onto the Hilbert space on the torus. The Fourier coefficients of the periodic Zak bases make up the discrete Zak bases. The two bases are mutually unbiased. We study these bases in detail, including a brief discussion of their relation to Aharonov's modular operators, and mention how they can be used to associate with the single degree of freedom of the line a pair of genuine qubits.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Fallis2013a,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The phase retrieval problem has a long history and is an important problem in many areas of optics. Theoretical understanding of phase retrieval is still limited and fundamental questions such as uniqueness and stability of the recovered solution are not yet fully understood. This paper provides several additions to the theoretical understanding of sparse phase retrieval. In particular we show that if the measurement ensemble can be chosen freely, as few as 4k-1 phaseless measurements suffice to guarantee uniqueness of a k-sparse M-dimensional real solution. We also prove that k{\^{}}2-k+2 Fourier magnitude measurements are sufficient under rather general conditions.},

abstract = {We address the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of transmission signals in OFDM and consider the performance of tone reservation for reduction of the PAPR. Tone reservation is unique among methods for reducing PAPR, because it does not affect information bearing coefficients and involves no additional coordination of transmitter and receiver. It is shown that if the OFDM system always satisfies a given peak-to-average power ratio constraint, then the efficiency of the system, defined as the ratio of the number of tones used for information to the entire number of tones used, must converge to zero as the total number of tones increases. More generally, we investigate and provide insight into a tradeoff between optimal signal and information properties for OFDM systems and show that it is necessary to use very small subsets of the available signals to achieve PAPR reduction using tone reservation. },

On the other hand, compressive sampling (CS) based interior tomography is a new innovation. Combining the strengths of these two novel subjects, we apply the interior tomography technique to local mouse cardiac imaging using respiration and cardiac gating with a CNT based micro-CT scanner. The major features of our method are: (1) it does not need exact prior knowledge inside an ROI; and (2) two orthogonal scout projections are employed to regularize the reconstruction. Both numerical simulations and in vivo mouse studies are performed to demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology.},

Each chapter concludes with a Notes section which contains suggestions for further study. The book is a companion volume to the second edition of Lehmann's "Testing Statistical Hypotheses". E.L. Lehmann is Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the recipient of honorary degrees from the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, and the University of Chicago. George Casella is the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor of Biological Statistics in The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. Casella has served as associate editor of The American Statistician, Statistical Science and JASA. He is currently the Theory and Methods Editor of JASA. Casella has authored two other textbooks (Statistical Inference, 1990, with Roger Berger and Variance Components, 1992, with Shayle A. Searle and Charles McCulloch).

abstract = {The Shannon/Nyquist sampling theorem specifies that to avoid losing information when capturing a signal, one must sample at least two times faster than the signal bandwidth. In many applications, including digital image and video cameras, the Nyquist rate is so high that too many samples result, making compression a necessity prior to storage or transmission. In other applications, including imaging systems (medical scanners and radars) and high-speed analog- to-digital converters, increasing the sampling rate is very expensive. This lecture note presents a new method to capture and represent compressible signals at a rate significantly below the Nyquist rate. This method, called compressive sensing, employs nonadaptive linear projections that preserve the structure of the signal; the signal is then reconstructed from these projections using an optimization process.},

abstract = {The integral of the Wigner function of a quantum mechanical system over a region or its boundary in the classical phase plane, is called a quasiprobability integral. Unlike a true probability integral, its value may lie outside the interval [0,1]. It is characterized by a corresponding selfadjoint operator, to be called a region or contour operator as appropriate, which is determined by the characteristic function of that region or contour. The spectral problem is studied for commuting families of region and contour operators associated with concentric disks and circles of given radius a. Their respective eigenvalues are determined as functions of a, in terms of the Gauss-Laguerre polynomials. These polynomials provide a basis of vectors in Hilbert space carrying the positive discrete series representations of the algebra su(1,1)or so(2,1). The explicit relation between the spectra of operators associated with disks and circles with proportional radii, is given in terms of the dicrete variable Meixner polynomials.},

abstract = {We present a method for recovering 3-D nonrigid structure from an image pair taken with a stereo rig. More specifically, we dedicate to recover shapes of nearly inextensible deformable surfaces. In our approach, we represent the surface as a 3-D triangulated mesh and formulate the reconstruction problem as an optimization problem consisting of data terms and shape terms. The data terms are model to image keypoint correspondences which can be formulated as second-order cone programming (SOCP) constraints using L(infinity) norm. The shape terms are designed to retaining original lengths of mesh edges which are typically nonconvex constraints. We will show that this optimization problem can be turned into a sequence of SOCP feasibility problems in which the nonconvex constraints are approximated as a set of convex constraints. Thanks to the efficient SOCP solver, the reconstruction problem can then be solved reliably and efficiently. As opposed to previous methods, ours neither involves smoothness constraints nor need an initial estimation, which enables us to recover shapes of surfaces with smooth, sharp and other complex deformations from a single image pair. The robustness and accuracy of our approach are evaluated quantitatively on synthetic data and qualitatively on real data.},

@article{Hashimi2010,
abstract = {Albicidins are potent DNA-gyrase-inhibiting antibiotics and phytotoxins synthesised by Xanthomonas albilineans. Functions have been deduced for some clustered biosynthetic genes, including a PKS-NRPS megasynthase, methyltransferases and regulatory genes, and resistance genes including a transporter and a gyrase-binding protein. More puzzling is the presence in this cluster of apparent aromatic metabolism genes. Here, we describe functional analysis of several such genes and propose a model for their role. An apparent benzoate CoA ligase (xabE) proved essential for albicidin production and pathogenicity. A neighbouring operon includes genes for p-aminobenzoate (PABA) metabolism. A PABA synthase fusion (pabAB) restored prototrophy in pabA and pabB mutants of Escherichia coli, proving functionality. Inactivation of pabAB increased susceptibility to sulphanilamide but did not block albicidin production. X. albilineans contains a remote pabB gene which evidently supplies enough PABA for albicidin biosynthesis in culture. Additional capacity from pabAB may be advantageous in more demanding environments such as infected plants. Downstream from pabAB are a known resistance gene (albG) and ubiC which encodes a p-hydroxybenzoate (PHBA) synthase. PHBA protects X. albilineans from inhibition by PABA. Therefore, coordinated expression may protect X. albilineans against toxicity of both the PABA intermediate and the albicidin product, under conditions that induce high-level antibiotic biosynthesis.},

We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

abstract = {The recently introduced theory of compressed sensing enables the reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals from a small set of nonadaptive, linear measurements. If properly chosen, the number of measurements can be much smaller than the number of Nyquist rate samples. Interestingly, it has been shown that random projections are a satisfactory measurement scheme. This has inspired the design of physical systems that directly implement similar measurement schemes. However, despite the intense focus on the reconstruction of signals, many (if not most) signal processing problems do not require a full reconstruction of the signal we are often interested only in solving some sort of detection problem or in the estimation of some function of the data. In this report, we show that the compressed sensing framework is useful for a wide range of statistical inference tasks. In particular, we demonstrate how to solve a variety of signal detection and estimation problems given the measurements without ever reconstructing the signals themselves. We provide theoretical bounds along with experimental results.},

abstract = {The goal of image restoration is to reconstruct the original scene from a degraded observation. This recovery process is critical to many image processing applications. Although classical linear image restoration has been thoroughly studied, the more difficult problem of blind image restoration has numerous research possibilities. We introduce the problem of blind deconvolution for images, provide an overview of the basic principles and methodologies behind the existing algorithms, and examine the current trends and the potential of this difficult signal processing problem. A broad review of blind deconvolution methods for images is given to portray the experience of the authors and of the many other researchers in this area. We first introduce the blind deconvolution problem for general signal processing applications. The specific challenges encountered in image related restoration applications are explained. Analytic descriptions of the structure of the major blind deconvolution approaches for images then follows. The application areas, convergence properties, complexity, and other implementation issues are addressed for each approach. We then discuss the strengths and limitations of various approaches based on theoretical expectations and computer simulations},

abstract = {Least squares fitting is in general not useful for high-dimensional linear models, in which the number of predictors is of the same or even larger order of magnitude than the number of samples. Theory developed in recent years has coined a paradigm according to which sparsity-promoting regularization is regarded as a necessity in such setting. Deviating from this paradigm, we show that non-negativity constraints on the regression coefficients may be similarly effective as explicit regularization. For a broad range of designs with Gram matrix having non-negative entries, we establish bounds on the {\$}\backslashell{\_}2{\$}-prediction error of non-negative least squares (NNLS) whose form qualitatively matches corresponding results for {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$}-regularization. Under slightly stronger conditions, it is established that NNLS followed by hard thresholding performs excellently in terms of support recovery of an (approximately) sparse target, in some cases improving over {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$}-regularization. A substantial advantage of NNLS over regularization-based approaches is the absence of tuning parameters, which is convenient from a computational as well as from a practitioner's point of view. Deconvolution of positive spike trains is presented as application.},

These measurements are usually much smaller than the number of samples that define the signal. From these small numbers of measurements, the signal is then reconstructed by non-linear procedure. Compressed sensing has recently emerged as a powerful tool for efficiently processing data in non-traditional ways. In this book, we highlight some of the key mathematical insights underlying sparse representation and compressed sensing and illustrate the role of these theories in classical vision, imaging and biometrics problems.},

abstract = {In this paper we revisit the Bialynicki-Birula {\&} Mycielski uncertainty principle and its cases of equality. This Shannon entropic version of the well-known Heisenberg uncertainty principle can be used when dealing with variables that admit no variance. In this paper, we extend this uncertainty principle to Renyi entropies. We recall that in both Shannon and Renyi cases, and for a given dimension n, the only case of equality occurs for Gaussian random vectors. We show that as n grows, however, the bound is also asymptotically attained in the cases of n-dimensional Student-t and Student-r distributions. A complete analytical study is performed in a special case of a Student-t distribution. We also show numerically that this effect exists for the particular case of a n-dimensional Cauchy variable, whatever the Renyi entropy considered, extending the results of Abe and illustrating the analytical asymptotic study of the student-t case. In the Student-r case, we show numerically that the same behavior occurs for uniformly distributed vectors. These particular cases and other ones investigated in this paper are interesting since they show that this asymptotic behavior cannot be considered as a "Gaussianization" of the vector when the dimension increases.},

abstract = {Ability to make decisions about medical treatment is compromised in significant numbers of people with neurological and psychiatric illness, and this incapacity frequently corresponds with compromised neuropsychological function. Although cognitive deficits occur often in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), no research has studied decisional capacity in that disease. The present investigation examined ability to understand treatment disclosures, which is a core component of decisional capacity, in 36 people with MS and 16 normal controls. MS patients with diminished neuropsychological function showed poor understanding of treatment disclosures compared to the control group, and diminished new learning and executive function correlated with poorer understanding. Nonetheless, with sufficient cuing, the MS patients with diminished neuropsychological function were able to display understanding that was equivalent to that of the control group. Implications of these results for clinical practice and medical research involving people with MS are discussed.},

@article{Walk2010,
abstract = {In this contribution we present a novel method for constructing orthogonal$\backslash$npulses for UWB impulse radio transmission under the FCC spectral$\backslash$nmask constraint. In contrast to previous work we combine a convex$\backslash$nformulation of the spectral design with L{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}wdin's orthogonalization$\backslash$nmethod $\backslash$cite{\{}Low50{\}}, which delivers a shift--orthogonal basis optimally$\backslash$nclose (in energy) to the initial pulse, which generates (in a stable$\backslash$nway) the shift--invariant space. The convex formulation of the spectral$\backslash$ndesign is achieved by approximating the FCC mask with a finite--order$\backslash$nfilter matched to Gaussian monocycles as input. The output pulse$\backslash$nthen has high energy concentration in the passband (NESP value).$\backslash$nUsing L{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}wdin's orthogonalization we compute the corresponding$\backslash$nshift--orthogonal pulse. We show that our approach is able to generate$\backslash$nfor finitely many shifts, orthogonal equal energy pulses with nearly$\backslash$nthe same NESP value. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonalization$\backslash$nprocedure can be well approximated using the Zak transform allowing$\backslash$nfor an efficient implementation with the discrete Fourier transform.$\backslash$nSurprisingly, we could observe, that for certain parameters, this$\backslash$napproximation yields almost the same performance as the exact L{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}wdin$\backslash$nmethod.},

We first investigate the minimal number of measurements for the success of the recovery of sparse signals without the phase information. We completely settle the minimality question for the real case and give a lower bound for the complex case. We then study the recovery performance of the {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$} minimization. In particular, we present the null space property which, to our knowledge, is the first sufficient and necessary condition for the success of {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$} minimization for {\$}k{\$}-sparse phase retrievable.},

abstract = {High peak values of transmission signals in wireless communication systems lead to wasteful energy consumption and out-of-band radiation. However, reducing peak values generally comes at the cost some other resource. We provide a theoretical contribution towards understanding the relationship between peak value reduction and the resulting cost in information rates. In particular, we address the relationship between peak values and the proportion of transmission signals allocated for information transmission when using a strategy known as tone reservation. We show that when using tone reservation in both OFDM and DS-CDMA systems, if a Peak-to-Average Power Ratio criterion is always satisfied, then the proportion of transmission signals that may be allocated for information transmission must tend to zero. We investigate properties of these two systems for sets of both finite and infinite cardinalities. We present properties that OFDM and DS-CDMA share in common as well as ways in which they fundamentally differ.},

abstract = {We analyze the sum-rate performance of a multi- antenna downlink system carrying more users than transmit antennas, with partial channel knowledge at the transmitter due to finite rate feedback. In order to exploit multiuser diversity, we show that the transmitter must have, in addition to directional information, information regarding the quality of each channel. Such information should reflect both the channel magnitude and the quantization error. Expressions for the SINR distribution and the sum-rate are derived, and tradeoffs between the number of feedback bits, the number of users, and the SNR are observed. In particular, for a target performance, having more users reduces feedback load.},

The basic techniques and theorems of analysis are presented in such a way that the intimate connections between its various branches are strongly emphasized. The traditionally separate subjects of 'real analysis' and 'complex analysis' are thus united in one volume. Some of the basic ideas from functional analysis are also included. This is the only book to take this unique approach. The third edition includes a new chapter on differentiation. Proofs of theorems presented in the book are concise and complete and many challenging exercises appear at the end of each chapter. The book is arranged so that each chapter builds upon the other, giving students a gradual understanding of the subject.},

We consider the case where data are drawn from sampling a probability distribution that has support on or near a submanifold of Euclidean space. We show how to “learn” the homology of the submanifold with high confidence. We discuss an algorithm to do this and provide learning-theoretic complexity bounds. Our bounds are obtained in terms of a condition number that limits the curvature and nearness to self-intersection of the submanifold. We are also able to treat the situation where the data are “noisy” and lie near rather than on the submanifold in question.},

abstract = {The purpose of this dissertation is to introduce a version of Stein's method of exchangeable pairs to solve problems in measure concentration. We specifically target systems of dependent random variables, since that is where the power of Stein's method is fully realized. Because the theory is quite abstract, we have tried to put in as many examples as possible. Some of the highlighted applications are as follows: (a) We shall find an easily verifiable condition under which a popular heuristic technique originating from physics, known as the ``mean field equations'' method, is valid. No such condition is currently known. (b) We shall present a way of using couplings to derive concentration inequalities. Although couplings are routinely used for proving decay of correlations, no method for using couplings to derive concentration bounds is available in the literature. This will be used to obtain (c) concentration inequalities with explicit constants under Dobrushin's condition of weak dependence. (d) We shall give a method for obtaining concentration of Haar measures using convergence rates of related random walks on groups. Using this technique and one of the numerous available results about rates of convergence of random walks, we will then prove (e) a quantitative version of Voiculescu's celebrated connection between random matrix theory and free probability.},

abstract = {We show that for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes whose Tanner graphs have sufficient expansion, the linear programming (LP) decoder of Feldman, Karger, and Wainwright can correct a constant fraction of errors. A random graph will have sufficient expansion with high probability, and recent work shows that such graphs can be constructed efficiently. A key element of our method is the use of a dual witness: a zero-valued dual solution to the decoding linear program whose existence proves decoding success. We show that as long as no more than a certain constant fraction of the bits are flipped by the channel, we can find a dual witness. This new method can be used for proving bounds on the performance of any LP decoder, even in a probabilistic setting. Our result implies that the word error rate of the LP decoder decreases exponentially in the code length under the binary-symmetric channel (BSC). This is the first such error bound for LDPC codes using an analysis based on "pseudocodewords." Recent work by Koetter and Vontobel shows that LP decoding and min-sum decoding of LDPC codes are closely related by the "graph cover" structure of their pseudocodewords; in their terminology, our result implies that that there exist families of LDPC codes where the minimum BSC pseudoweight grows linearly in the block length},

@article{Ungar2013,
abstract = {In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai- Lobachevskian geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry, meaning that the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced. The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement that, in two dimensional space, for any given line R and point P not on R, there is exactly one line through P that does not intersect R; i.e., that is parallel to R. In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two distinct lines through P which do not intersect R, so the parallel postulate is false. Models have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry, thus proving that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid.},

abstract = {We introduce a new iterative algorithm to find sparse solutions of underdetermined linear systems. The algorithm, a simple combination of the Iterative Hard Thresholding algorithm and the Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit algorithm, is called Hard Thresholding Pursuit. We study its general convergence and notice in particular that only a finite number of iterations are required. We then show that, under a certain condition on the restricted isometry constant of the matrix of the linear system, the Hard Thresholding Pursuit algorithm indeed finds all ssparse solutions. This condition, which reads $\delta$3s {\textgreater} 1/√3, is heuristically better than the sufficient conditions currently available for other compressive sensing algorithms. It applies to fast versions of the algorithm, too, including the Iterative Hard Thresholding algorithm. Stability with respect to sparsity defect and robustness with respect to measurement error are also guaranteed under the condition $\delta$3s {\textgreater} 1/√3. We conclude with some numerical experiments to demonstrate the good empirical performance and the low complexity of the Hard Thresholding Pursuit algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a sharp version of a given blurry image when the blur kernel is unknown. Previous methods often introduce an image-independent regularizer (such as Gaussian or sparse priors) on the desired blur kernel. We shall show that the blurry image itself encodes rich information about the blur kernel. Such information can be found through analyzing and comparing how the spectrum of an image as a convolution operator changes before and after blurring. Our analysis leads to an effective convex regularizer on the blur kernel which depends only on the given blurry image. We show that the minimizer of this regularizer guarantees to give good approximation to the blur kernel if the original image is sharp enough. By combining this powerful regularizer with conventional image deblurring techniques, we show how we could significantly improve the deblurring results through simulations and experiments on real images. In addition, our analysis and experiments help explaining a widely accepted doctrine; that is, the edges are good features for deblurring.},

@book{MacKay2005,
abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

@article{Yeung2008,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This work proposes a family of greedy algorithms to jointly reconstruct a set of vectors that are (i) nonnegative and (ii) simultaneously sparse with a shared support set. The proposed algorithms generalize previous approaches that were designed to impose these constraints individually. Similar to previous greedy algorithms for sparse recovery, the proposed algorithms iteratively identify promising support indices. In contrast to previous approaches, the support index selection procedure has been adapted to prioritize indices that are consistent with both the nonnegativity and shared support constraints. Empirical results demonstrate for the first time that the combined use of simultaneous sparsity and nonnegativity constraints can substantially improve recovery performance relative to existing greedy algorithms that impose less signal structure.},

abstract = {This is a survey of nonlinear approximation, especially that part of the subject which is important in numerical computation. Nonlinear approximation means that the approximants do not come from linear spaces but rather from nonlinear manifolds. The central question to be studied is what, if any, are the advantages of nonlinear approximation over the simpler, more established, linear methods. This question is answered by studying the rate of approximation which is the decrease in error versus the number of parameters in the approximant. The number of parameters usually correlates well with computational effort. It is shown that in many settings the rate of nonlinear approximation can be characterized by certain smoothness conditions which are significantly weaker than required in the linear theory. Emphasis in the survey will be placed on approximation by piecewise polynomials and wavelets as well as their numerical implementation. Results on highly nonlinear methods such as optimal basis selection and greedy algorithms (adaptive pursuit) are also given. Applications to image processing, statistical estimation, regularity for {\{}PDEs,{\}} and adaptive algorithms are discussed.},

abstract = {Is compressive sensing overrated? Or can it live up to our expectations? What will come after compressive sensing and sparsity? And what has Galileo Galilei got to do with it? Compressive sensing has taken the signal processing community by storm. A large corpus of research devoted to the theory and numerics of compressive sensing has been published in the last few years. Moreover, compressive sensing has inspired and initiated intriguing new research directions, such as matrix completion. Potential new applications emerge at a dazzling rate. Yet some important theoretical questions remain open, and seemingly obvious applications keep escaping the grip of compressive sensing. In this paper I discuss some of the recent progress in compressive sensing and point out key challenges and opportunities as the area of compressive sensing and sparse representations keeps evolving. I also attempt to assess the long-term impact of compressive sensing.},

It is well-known that these$\backslash$ntwo scales$\backslash$n$\backslash$nof spaces cover many well-known spaces of functions and distributions$\backslash$nsuch$\backslash$n$\backslash$nas H{\"{o}}lder--Zygmund spaces, Sobolev spaces, Besov spaces, and Hardy$\backslash$nspaces.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe present book concentrates mainly on those developments in recent$\backslash$ntimes$\backslash$n$\backslash$nwhich are related to the nowadays numerous applications of function$\backslash$nspaces$\backslash$n$\backslash$nto numerics, signal processing and fractal analysis. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe book has 9$\backslash$n$\backslash$nchapters. Chapter 1 contains a description of the theory of function$\backslash$nspaces$\backslash$n$\backslash$nfrom the 1990s to now. Yet, the author restricts himself to the essentials$\backslash$n$\backslash$nneeded to make this book self-contained and readable. Chapters 2$\backslash$nand 3 deal$\backslash$n$\backslash$nwith building blocks in (isotropic) spaces of type B{\^{}}s{\_}{\{}pq{\}} and$\backslash$nF{\^{}}s{\_}{\{}pq{\}}$\backslash$n$\backslash$nin {\{}$\backslash$mathbb R{\}}{\^{}}n, especially with (nonsmooth) atoms (Chapter 2)$\backslash$nand with$\backslash$n$\backslash$nwavelet bases and wavelet frames (Chapter 3). The author discusses$\backslash$nsome$\backslash$n$\backslash$nconsequences: pointwise multiplier assertions, positivity properties$\backslash$nand$\backslash$n$\backslash$nlocal smoothness problems. Chapter 4 is devoted to the theory of$\backslash$nfunction$\backslash$n$\backslash$nspaces in (bounded) Lipschitz domains in {\{}$\backslash$mathbb R{\}}{\^{}}n. The author$\backslash$ntreats$\backslash$n$\backslash$nwavelet representations of anisotropic function spaces and of weighted$\backslash$n$\backslash$nfunction spaces on {\{}$\backslash$mathbb R{\}}{\^{}}n, respectively, in Chapters 5 and$\backslash$n6.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nChapter 7 studies fractal quantities of measures and spectral assertions$\backslash$nof$\backslash$n$\backslash$nfractal elliptic operators. Finally, in Chapters 8 and 9, the author$\backslash$n$\backslash$ndevelops a new theory for function spaces on quasimetric spaces and$\backslash$non sets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn short, this book is well-written and its content is rich and well$\backslash$n$\backslash$norganized.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe author's other two monographs have already yielded deep$\backslash$n$\backslash$ninfluence to the development of the theory of function spaces.

@article{Cohen2008a,
abstract = {Compressed sensing is a new concept in signal processing where one seeks to minimize the number of measurements to be taken from signals while still retaining the information necessary to approximate them well. The ideas have their origins in certain abstract results from functional analysis and approximation theory by Kashin but were recently brought into the forefront by the work of Candes, Romberg, and Tao and of Donoho who constructed concrete algorithms and showed their promise in application. There remain several fundamental questions on both the theoretical and practical sides of compressed sensing. This paper is primarily concerned with one of these theoretical issues revolving around just how well compressed sensing can approximate a given signal from a given budget of fixed linear measurements, as compared to adaptive linear measurements. More precisely, we consider discrete signals xinR N , allocate n{\textless}N linear measurements of x , and we describe the range of k for which these measurements encode enough information to recover x in the sense of ellp to the accuracy of best k -term approximation. We also consider the problem of having such accuracy only with high probability.},

@article{Donoho2009a,
abstract = {We review connections between phase transitions in high-dimensional combinatorial geometry and phase transitions occurring in modern high-dimensional data analysis and signal processing. In data analysis, such transitions arise as abrupt breakdown of linear model selection, robust data fitting or compressed sensing reconstructions, when the complexity of the model or the number of outliers increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial geometry, these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face counts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in these very different problems appear in the same critical locations after appropriate calibration of variables. These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling, they place hard limits on the degree to which the now ubiquitous high-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place hard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate outliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp boundary of the undersampling/sparsity trade-off curve in undersampling theorems. Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume that the underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed Gaussian elements. In applications, however, it often seems that Gaussianity is not required. We conducted an extensive computational experiment and formal inferential analysis to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are universal across a range of underlying matrix ensembles. We ran millions of linear programs using random matrices spanning several matrix ensembles and problem sizes; visually, the empirical phase transitions do not depend on the ensemble, and they agree extremely well with the asymptotic theory assuming Gaussianity. Careful statistical analysis reveals discrepancies that can be explained as transient terms, decaying with problem size. The experimental results are thus consistent with an asymptotic large-n universality across matrix ensembles; finite-sample universality can be rejected.},

abstract = {Let A be an n×N real-valued matrix with n{\textless}N; we count the number of k-faces f k (AQ) when Q is either the standard N-dimensional hypercube I N or else the positive orthant ℝ + N . To state results simply, consider a proportional-growth asymptotic, where for fixed $\delta$,$\rho$ in (0,1), we have a sequence of matrices TeXA{\_}{\{}n,N{\_}{\{}n{\}}{\}} and of integers k n with n/N n →$\delta$ and k n /n→$\rho$ as n→∞. If each matrix TeXA{\_}{\{}n,N{\_}{\{}n{\}}{\}} has its columns in general position, then f k (AI N )/f k (I N ) tends to zero or one depending on whether $\rho${\textgreater}min (0,2−$\delta$ −1) or $\rho$$\delta$ −1). Also, if each TeXA{\_}{\{}n,N{\_}{\{}n{\}}{\}} is a random draw from a distribution which is invariant under right multiplication by signed permutations, then f k (Aℝ + N )/f k (ℝ + N ) tends almost surely to zero or one depending on whether $\rho${\textgreater}min (0,2−$\delta$ −1) or $\rho$$\delta$ −1). We make a variety of contrasts to related work on projections of the simplex and/or cross-polytope. These geometric face-counting results have implications for signal processing, information theory, inverse problems, and optimization. Indeed, face counting is related to conditions for uniqueness of solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations. Below, let A be a fixed n×N matrix, n{\textless}N, with columns in general position. Call a vector in ℝ + N k -sparse if it has at most k nonzeros. For such a k-sparse vector x 0, b=Ax 0 generates an underdetermined system b=Ax having k-sparse solution. Among inequality-constrained systems Ax=b, x≥0, having k-sparse solutions, the fraction having a unique nonnegative solution is f k (Aℝ + N )/f k (ℝ + N ). Call a vector in the hypercube I N k-simple if all entries except at most k are at the bounds 0 or 1. For such a k-simple vector x 0, b=Ax 0 generates an underdetermined system b=Ax with k-simple solution. Among inequality-constrained systems Ax=b, x∈I N , having k-simple solutions, the fraction having a unique hypercube-constrained solution is f k (AI N )/f k (I N ).},

abstract = {This paper describes a new methodology and associated theoretical analysis for rapid and accurate extraction of level sets of a multivariate function from noisy data. The identification of the boundaries of such sets is an important theoretical problem with applications for digital elevation maps, medical imaging, and pattern recognition. This problem is significantly different from classical segmentation because level-set boundaries may not correspond to singularities or edges in the underlying function; as a result, segmentation methods which rely upon detecting boundaries would be potentially ineffective in this regime. This issue is addressed in this paper through a novel error metric sensitive to both the error in the location of the level-set estimate and the deviation of the function from the critical level. Hoeffding's inequality is used to derive a novel regularization term that is distinctly different from regularization methods used in conventional image denoising settings. Building upon this foundation, it is possible to derive error performance bounds for the proposed estimator and demonstrate that it exhibits near minimax optimal error decay rates for large classes of level-set problems. The proposed method automatically adapts to the spatially varying regularity of both the boundary of the level set and the underlying function.},

abstract = {An in-depth overview of polyhedral methods and efficient algorithms in combinatorial optimization. These methods form a broad, coherent and powerful kernel in combinatorial optimization, with strong links to discrete mathematics, mathematical programming and computer science. In eight parts, various areas are treated, each starting with an elementary introduction to the area, with short, elegant proofs of the principal results, and each evolving to the more advanced methods and results, with full proofs of some of the deepest theorems in the area. Over 4000 references to further research are given, and historical surveys on the basic subjects are presented.},

@book{Lehmann2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of epsilon-delta entropy for "probabilistic
metric spaces." The concept arises in the study of efficient data
transmission, in other words, in "Data Compression." In a case of
particular interest, the space is the space of paths of a stochastic
process, for example L2[ 0, 1] under the probability distribution
induced by a mean-continuous process on the unit interval. For any
epsilon and delta both greater than zero, the epsilon-delta entropy
of any probabilistic metric space is finite. However, when delta
is zero, the resulting entropy, called simply the epsilon entropy
of the space, can be infinite. We give a simple condition on the
eigenvalues of a process on L2[ 0, 1] such that any process satisfying
that condition has finite epsilon entropy for any epsilon greater
than zero. And, for any set of eigenvalues not satisfying the given
condition, we produce a mean-continuous process on the unit interval
having infinite epsilon entropy for every epsilon greater than zero.
The condition is merely that {\^{a}}?? n{\"{I}}?n 2 be finite, where {\"{I}}?1 2 {\^{a}}?¥
{\"{I}}?2 2 {\^{a}}?¥ {\^{a}}?¯ are the eigenvalues of the process.},

@book{Shrestha2011,
abstract = {There is growing interest in understanding the nature and consequences of interactions among infectious agents. Pathogen interactions can be operational at different scales, either within a co-infected host or in host populations where they co-circulate, and can be either cooperative or competitive. The detection of interactions among pathogens has typically involved the study of synchrony in the oscillations of the protagonists, but as we show here, phase association provides an unreliable dynamical fingerprint for this task. We assess the capacity of a likelihood-based inference framework to accurately detect and quantify the presence and nature of pathogen interactions on the basis of realistic amounts and kinds of simulated data. We show that when epidemiological and demographic processes are well understood, noisy time series data can contain sufficient information to allow correct inference of interactions in multi-pathogen systems. The inference power is dependent on the strength and time-course of the underlying mechanism: stronger and longer-lasting interactions are more easily and more precisely quantified. We examine the limitations of our approach to stochastic temporal variation, under-reporting, and over-aggregation of data. We propose that likelihood shows promise as a basis for detection and quantification of the effects of pathogen interactions and the determination of their (competitive or cooperative) nature on the basis of population-level time-series data.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider the {\$}\backslashchi{\$}-function (the Holevo capacity of constrained channel) and the convex closure of the output entropy for arbitrary infinite dimensional channel.   It is shown that the {\$}\backslashchi{\$}-function of an arbitrary channel is a concave lower semicontinuous function on the whole state space, having continuous restriction to any set of continuity of the output entropy.   The explicit representation for the convex closure of the output entropy is obtained and its properties are explored. It is shown that the convex closure of the output entropy coincides with the convex hull of the output entropy on the convex set of states with finite output entropy. Similarly to the case of the {\$}\backslashchi{\$}-function, it is proved that the convex closure of the output entropy has continuous restriction to any set of continuity of output entropy. Some applications of these results to the theory of entanglement are discussed.   The obtained properties of the convex closure of the output entropy make it possible to generalize to the infinite dimensional case the convex duality approach to the additivity problem.},

@article{Lu2005,
abstract = {This paper develops a mathematical theory of super-resolution. Broadly speaking, super- resolution is the problemof recovering the fine details of an object—the high end of its spectrum— from coarse scale information only—from samples at the low end of the spectrum. Suppose we have many point sources at unknown locations in [0, 1] and with unknown complex-valued am- plitudes. We only observe Fourier samples of this object up until a frequency cut-off fc. We show that one can super-resolve these point sources with infinite precision—i.e. recover the exact locations and amplitudes—by solving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be reformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance between sources is at least 2/fc. This result extends to higher dimensions and other models. In one dimension for instance, it is possible to recover a piecewise smooth function by resolving the discontinuity points with infinite precision as well. We also show that the theory and methods are robust to noise. In particular, in the discrete setting we develop some theoretical results explaining how the accuracy of the super-resolved signal is expected to degrade when both the noise level and the super-resolution factor vary.},

abstract = {Different Faces of Geometry - edited by the world renowned geometers S. Donaldson, Ya. Eliashberg, and M. Gromov - presents the current state, new results, original ideas and open questions from the following important topics in modern geometry: Amoebas and Tropical Geometry Convex Geometry and Asymptotic Geometric Analysis Differential Topology of 4-Manifolds 3-Dimensional Contact Geometry Floer Homology and Low-Dimensional Topology K{\"{a}}hler Geometry Lagrangian and Special Lagrangian Submanifolds Refined Seiberg-Witten Invariants. These apparently diverse topics have a common feature in that they are all areas of exciting current activity. The Editors have attracted an impressive array of leading specialists to author chapters for this volume: G. Mikhalkin (USA-Canada-Russia), V.D. Milman (Israel) and A.A. Giannopoulos (Greece), C. LeBrun (USA), Ko Honda (USA), P. Ozsv{\'{a}}th (USA) and Z. Szab{\'{o}} (USA), C. Simpson (France), D. Joyce (UK) and P. Seidel (USA), and S. Bauer (Germany). "One can distinguish various themes running through the different contributions. There is some emphasis on invariants defined by elliptic equations and their applications in low-dimensional topology, symplectic and contact geometry (Bauer, Seidel, Ozsv{\'{a}}th and Szab{\'{o}}). These ideas enter, more tangentially, in the articles of Joyce, Honda and LeBrun. Here and elsewhere, as well as explaining the rapid advances that have been made, the articles convey a wonderful sense of the vast areas lying beyond our current understanding. Simpson's article emphasizes the need for interesting new constructions (in that case of K{\"{a}}hler and algebraic manifolds), a point which is also made by Bauer in the context of 4-manifolds and the "11/8 conjecture". LeBrun's article gives another perspective on 4-manifold theory, via Riemannian geometry, and the challenging open questions involving the geometry of even "well-known" 4-manifolds. There are also striking contrasts between the articles. The authors have taken different approaches: for example, the thoughtful essay of Simpson, the new research results of LeBrun and the thorough expositions with homework problems of Honda. One can also ponder the differences in the style of mathematics. In the articles of Honda, Giannopoulos and Milman, and Mikhalkin, the "geometry" is present in a very vivid and tangible way; combining respectively with topology, analysis and algebra. The papers of Bauer and Seidel, on the other hand, makes the point that algebraic and algebro-topological abstraction (triangulated categories, spectra) can play an important role in very unexpected ways in concrete geometric problems." - From the Preface by the Editors},

abstract = {The influence of the nuclear medium on the production of charged hadrons in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering has been studied by the HERMES experiment at DESY using a 27.5 GeV positron beam. The differential multiplicity of charged hadrons and identified charged pions from nitrogen relative to that from deuterium has been measured as a function of the virtual photon energy nu and the fraction z of this energy transferred to the hadron. There are observed substantial reductions of the multiplicity ratio R-M(h) at low nu and at high z, both of which are well described by a gluon-bremsstrahlung model of hadronization. A significant difference of the nu -dependence of R-M(h) is found between positive and negative A hadrons. This is interpreted in terms of a difference between the formation times of protons and pions, using a phenomenological model to describe the nu- and z-dependence of R-M(h).},

Notably, by concentrating on just two non-Gaussian models, a large set of tools is developed that encompass a large portion of the nonlinear signal processing tools proposed in the literature over the past several decades. Key features include: * Numerous problems at the end of each chapter to aid development and understanding * Examples and case studies provided throughout the book in a wide range of applications bring the text to life and place the theory into context * A set of 60+ MATLAB software m-files allowing the reader to quickly design and apply any of the nonlinear signal processing algorithms described in the book to an application of interest is available on the accompanying FTP site.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is regulated on both genetic and molecular levels. Pro- and anti-angiogenic stimuli maintain the angiogenic balance, and the tipping of that balance toward pro-angiogenic activity is critical for tumor growth and survival. Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, many of which are fragments from large extracellular matrix proteins, counter the effect of growth factors and keep angiogenesis in check. This chapter will discuss the molecular mechanisms of endogenous inhibitors derived from type IV collagen and review the in vitro and in vivo assays available to study their role in angiogenesis.},

abstract = {Summary. We consider a problem of testing mixture proportions using two-sample data, one from group one and the other from a mixture of groups one and two with unknown proportion, lambda, for being in group two. Various statistical applications, including microarray study, infectious epidemiological studies, case-control studies with contaminated controls, clinical trials allowing "nonresponders," genetic studies for gene mutation, and fishery applications can be formulated in this setup. Under the assumption that the log ratio of probability (density) functions from the two groups is linear in the observations, we propose a generalized score test statistic to test the mixture proportion. Under some regularity conditions, it is shown that this statistic converges to a weighted chi-squared random variable under the null hypothesis of lambda= 0, where the weight depends only on the sampling fraction of both groups. The permutation method is used to provide more reliable finite sample approximation. Simulation results and two real data applications are presented.},

It was discussed earlier [quant-ph/0104126] a construction with (2n-1)n projectors for the dimension n. For n=2 it is a set with six projectors associated with eigenvectors of three Pauli matrices, but for n{\textgreater}2 the construction produces not such a `regular' set. In this paper are revisited some results of previous work [quant-ph/0104126] and discussed another, more symmetric construction with the Weyl matrix pair (as the generalization of Pauli matrices). In the particular case of prime n it is the mutually unbiased set with (n+1)n projectors. In appendix is shown an example of application of complete sets for discussions about separability and random robustness.},

They are intended for a graduate course on Compressed Sensing in the Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt University. I will update them during the Spring semester of 2009 to produce the draft of a coherent manuscript by May 2009. I expect to continue improving it afterwards. You should keep in mind that, because Compressed Sensing is a young and rapidly evolving field, these notes may become quickly obsolete. Besides, because Compressed Sensing is at the intersection of many scientific disciplines, several lines of approach for a course on the subject can be taken. The perspective adopted here is definitely a mathematical one, since I am a mathematician by training and by taste. This bias has obviously influenced the selection of topics I chose to cover, and so has my exposition to the area during the past few years. Other than reading research articles, this consisted of a Shanks workshop given by Joel Tropp at Vanderbilt University, a workshop on the 1 -norm held at Texas A{\&}M University, and a series of talks given},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We consider a finite mixture of regressions (FMR) model for high-dimensional inhomogeneous data where the number of covariates may be much larger than sample size. We propose an l1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator in an appropriate parameterization. This kind of estimation belongs to a class of problems where optimization and theory for non-convex functions is needed. This distinguishes itself very clearly from high-dimensional estimation with convex loss- or objective functions, as for example with the Lasso in linear or generalized linear models. Mixture models represent a prime and important example where non-convexity arises.   For FMR models, we develop an efficient EM algorithm for numerical optimization with provable convergence properties. Our penalized estimator is numerically better posed (e.g., boundedness of the criterion function) than unpenalized maximum likelihood estimation, and it allows for effective statistical regularization including variable selection. We also present some asymptotic theory and oracle inequalities: due to non-convexity of the negative log-likelihood function, different mathematical arguments are needed than for problems with convex losses. Finally, we apply the new method to both simulated and real data.},

@book{Holevo2011,
abstract = {The mathematical language of modern quantum mechanics is operator theory. Operators play there a role similar to functions in classical me- chanics, probability theory and statistics. However, while the use of func- tions in classical theories is founded on premises which seem intuitively quite clear, in quantum theory the situation with operators is different. Historically the “matrix mechanics” of Heisenberg and the “wave mechanics” of Schr¨odinger which gave rise to the contemporary form of quantum theory, originated from ingenious attempts to t mathemat- ical objects able to reect some unusual (from the macroscopic point of view) features of microparticle behavior – in particular, a peculiar combination of continuous and discrete properties. The “probabilistic interpretation” developed later by Born and others elucidated the mean- ing of operator formalism by postulating rules connecting mathematical objects with observable quantities. However a good deal of arbitrari- ness remained in these postulates and the most convincing argument for quantum-theoretical explanations was still the “striking” coincidence of theoretical predictions with experimental data. This state of affairs gave rise to numerous attempts, on one hand, to nd classical alternatives to quantum theory which would give an equally satisfactory description of the experimental data, and on the other hand, to nd out physical and philosophical arguments for justifying the inevitability of the new me- chanics. Notwithstanding the impressive philosophical achievements in this eld there was and still is a need for the structural investigation of quan- tum theory from a more mathematical point of view aimed at elucidating the connections between the entities of the physical world and the ele- ments of operator formalism. The present book is essentially in this line of research opened by the classical von Neumann's treatise “Mathemati- cal Foundations of Quantum Mechanics”. However it differs from most subsequent investigations by the strong emphasis on the statistical rather than “logical” essence of quantum theory; it gives an account of recentxiv Alexander Holevo progress in the statistical theory of quantum measurement, stimulated by the new applications of quantum mechanics, particularly in quantum op- tics. The rst three chapters give an introduction to the foundations of quan- tum mechanics, addressed to the reader interested in the structure of quantum theory and its relations with classical probability. In spite of the mathematical character of the presentation it is not “axiomatic”. Its purpose is to display the origin of the basic elements of operator formal- ism resting, as far as possible, upon the classical probabilistic concepts. The present revision is not an end in itself – it emerged from the so- lution of concrete problems concerning the quantum limitations to mea- surement accuracy, arising in applications. So far there has been no gen- eral approach to such kind of problems. The methods of mathemati- cal statistics adapted for classical measurements required radial quantum modication. The last chapters of the book are devoted to the recently developed quantum estimation theory, which is an analog of the corre- sponding branch of mathematical statistics. We now give a more detailed account of the contents of the book. In Chapter 1 the general concepts of state and measurement are introduced on the basis of statistical analysis of an experimental situation. From the very beginning this approach leads to a substantial generalization of the Dirac-von Neumann concept of an observable. Mathematically it is re- ected by the occurrence of arbitrary resolutions of identity in place of or- thogonal ones (spectral measures) and the repudiation of self-adjointness as an indispensable attribute of an observable. In this way nonorthog- onal resolutions of identity like the “overcomplete” system of coherent states known in physics for rather a long time nd their proper place in quantum phenomenology. The new concept of quantum measurement is central for the whole book. The notion of statistical model exploited in Chapter 1 is quite general and may nd applications different from quantum theory. It gives us a new insight into the still controversial “hidden variables” problem. In Chapter 2 the elements of operator theory in Hilbert space are intro- duced to provide mathematical background for the subsequent material. As compared to standard presentations relatively much attention is paid to nonorthogonal resolutions of identity and related questions. A novel feature is also the introduction of the L 2 spaces of observables associ- ated with a quantum state and playing a role similar to the Hilbert space of random variables with nite second moment in probability theory. These L 2 spaces give the framework for a calculus of unbounded operators. Of fundamental importance to quantum theory are groups of symme- tries. In Chapter 3 elementary quantum mechanics is considered from thisxv Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects of Quantum Theory point of view. An important result of this discussion is the isolation of the notion of covariant measurement which ties physical quantities with cer- tain classes of resolutions of identity in the underlying Hilbert space. In this way we construct quantum measurements canonically corresponding to such quantities as time, phase of harmonic oscillator, angle of rotation and joint measurement of coordinate and velocity. Allowing the broader concept of quantum measurement enables us to resolve old troubles of quantum theory connected with the non-existence of self-adjoint opera- tors having the required covariance properties. Chapter 4 is devoted to a more advanced study of covariant measure- ments and extreme quantum limits for the accuracy of estimation of phys- ical parameters. The latter problem becomes important in view of the progress in experimental physics. We present a unied statistical ap- proach to “non-standard” uncertainty relations of the “angle-angular mo- mentum” type. They appear to be related to the quantum analog of the Hunt-Stein theorem in mathematical statistics. A general conclusion which can be drawn from Chapter 4 is that the requirements of covariance and optimality, i.e., extremal quantum accuracy, determine the canoni- cal measurement of a “shift” parameter, such as angle, coordinate, time, uniquely up to a “gauge” transformation. An example of a situation where quantum limitations are important is provided by optical communication. As it is known, “quantum noise” dis- torting the signal in the optical range can be much more signicant than the thermal background radiation. As in ordinary communication theory the problem of signal estimation arises, but now it requires a specically quantum-theoretic formulation and solution. Chapter 5 is devoted to the so-called Gaussian states which, in par- ticular, describe radiation elds in optical communication theory. The presentation is intended to make maximal use of the remarkable parallel with the Gaussian probability distributions. An important role is played here by quantum characteristic functions. In Chapter 6 the general inequalities for the measurement mean square errors are derived, which are quantum analogs of the well-known Cramer- Rao inequality in mathematical statistics. The best unbiased measure- ments of the mean-value parameters of a Gaussian state are describ- ed. Needless to say, the present book cannot (and is not intended to) re- place the standard textbooks on quantum mechanics. Most of the impor- tant topics, such as perturbation theory, are apparently out of its scope. Nor does it pretend to give a full account of quantum measurements. We have discussed only those problems which concern measurement statis- tics and do not require consideration of state changes after measurements.The references to the relevant work on “open” quantum systems and quantum stochastic processes can be found in the comments. The author's intention was to write a book accessible to a wide circle of readers, both mathematicians and physicists. As a result, the presenta- tion, being in general mathematical, is rather informal and certainly not “the most economic” from a mathematical point of view. On the other hand, it neglects some subtleties concerning measurability etc. As a rule a rigorous treatment can be found in the special papers refered to. The necessary background for the whole material is knowledge of fundamen- tals of probability theory. Mathematically the most elementary is Chapter 1 which uses mainly nite-dimensional linear analysis. The functional analytic minimum is given in Section 2.1-2.6 of Chapter 2, and a math- ematically educated reader may just glance over it. On the other hand, a reader familiar with quantum mechanics can omit the detailed discussion of such topics as harmonic oscillators and spin in Chapter 3, included to make the presentation self-contained, and concentrate on less familiar things. The Dirac notation is used intensively throughout the book but with round brackets for the inner product as accepted in mathematical litera- ture. The angle brackets, associated with the averaging symbol in statis- tical mechanics, are reserved for the different inner product dening the correlation of a pair of observables. To denote a quantum state as well as its density operator we use the letter S (not the usual $\rho$ ) allied to the notation P for the classical state (probability distribution). The author's thanks are due to Prof. D. P. Zelobenko and the late Prof. Yu. M. Shirokov who read the manuscript and made useful comments. In translating the book the author took the opportunity of improving the presentation which concerned mainly Chapters 3, 4. Few references were added. The author is grateful to Prof. Yu. A. Rozanov and Prof. P. R. Krishnaiah for providing the opportunity of translating this book for North-},

abstract = {Recently, a lot of attention has been devoted to finding physically realisable operations that realise as closely as possible certain desired transformations between quantum states, e.g. quantum cloning, teleportation, quantum gates, etc. Mathematically, this problem boils down to finding a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) linear map that maximizes the (mean) fidelity between the map itself and the desired transformation. In this note we want to draw attention to the fact that this problem belongs to the class of so-called semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. As SDP problems are convex, it immediately follows that they do not suffer from local optima. Furthermore, this implies that the numerical optimization of the CPTP map can, and should, be done using methods from the well-established SDP field, as these methods exploit convexity and are guaranteed to converge to the real solution. Finally, we show how the duality inherent to convex and SDP problems can be exploited to prove analytically the optimality of a proposed solution. We give an example of how to apply this proof method by proving the optimality of Hardy and Song's proposed solution for the universal qubit {\$}\backslashtheta{\$}-shifter (quant-ph/0102100).},

abstract = {We consider a finite mixture of regressions (FMR) model for high-dimensional inhomogeneous data where the number of covariates may be much larger than sample size. We propose an l1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator in an appropriate parameterization. This kind of estimation belongs to a class of problems where optimization and theory for non-convex functions is needed. This distinguishes itself very clearly from high-dimensional estimation with convex loss- or objective functions, as for example with the Lasso in linear or generalized linear models. Mixture models represent a prime and important example where non-convexity arises. For FMR models, we develop an efficient EM algorithm for numerical optimization with provable convergence properties. Our penalized estimator is numerically better posed (e.g., boundedness of the criterion function) than unpenalized maximum likelihood estimation, and it allows for effective statistical regularization including variable selection. We also present some asymptotic theory and oracle inequalities: due to non-convexity of the negative log-likelihood function, different mathematical arguments are needed than for problems with convex losses. Finally, we apply the new method to both simulated and real data.},

The problem is studied in the context of coded imaging systems, where the diversity provided by the random masks makes the deconvolution problem significantly better conditioned than it would be from a set of direct measurements. We start by studying the conditioning of the forward linear measurement operator that describes the system in terms of the number of masks {\$}K{\$}, the dimension of image {\$}L{\$}, the number of sensors {\$}N{\$}, and certain characteristics of the blur kernel. We show that stable deconvolution is possible when {\$}KN \backslashgeq L\backslashlog L{\$}, meaning that the total number of sensor measurements is within a logarithmic factor of the image size. Next, we consider the scenario where the target image is known to be sparse. We show that under mild conditions on the blurring kernel, the linear system is a restricted isometry when the number of masks is within a logarithmic factor of the number of active components, making the image recoverable using any one of a number of sparse recovery techniques.},

@article{Figueiredo2007,
abstract = {Standard formulations of image/signal deconvolution under wavelet-based priors/regularizers lead to very high-dimensional optimization problems involving the following difficulties: the non-Gaussian (heavy-tailed) wavelet priors lead to objective functions which are nonquadratic, usually nondifferentiable, and sometimes even nonconvex; the presence of the convolution operator destroys the separability which underlies the simplicity of wavelet-based denoising. This paper presents a unified view of several recently proposed algorithms for handling this class of optimization problems, placing them in a common majorization-minimization (MM) framework. One of the classes of algorithms considered (when using quadratic bounds on nondifferentiable log-priors) shares the infamous "singularity issue" (SI) of "iteratively reweighted least squares" (IRLS) algorithms: the possibility of having to handle infinite weights, which may cause both numerical and convergence issues. In this paper, we prove several new results which strongly support the claim that the SI does not compromise the usefulness of this class of algorithms. Exploiting the unified MM perspective, we introduce a new algorithm, resulting from using l1 bounds for nonconvex regularizers; the experiments confirm the superior performance of this method, when compared to the one based on quadratic majorization. Finally, an experimental comparison of the several algorithms, reveals their relative merits for different standard types of scenarios.},

A popular way of performing this recovery is by finding x such that Ax = Ax , and x 1 is minimal. It is known that this approach works if A is a random dense matrix, chosen from a proper distribution. In this paper, we investigate this procedure for the case where A is binary and very sparse. We show that, both in theory and in practice, sparse matrices are essentially as good as the dense ones. At the same time, sparse binary matrices provide additional benefits, such as reduced encoding and decoding time.},

abstract = {Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is a technology that transmits multiple signals simultaneously over a single transmission path, such as a cable or wireless system. Each signal travels within its own unique frequency range (carrier), which is modulated by the data (text, voice, video, etc.). Orthogonal FDM's (OFDM) spread spectrum technique distributes the data over a large number of carriers that are spaced apart at precise frequencies. This spacing provides the "orthogonality" in this technique which prevents the demodulators from seeing frequencies other than their own. The benefits of OFDM are high spectral efficiency, resiliency to RF interference, and lower multi-path distortion. This is useful because in a typical terrestrial broadcasting scenario there are multipath-channels (i.e. the transmitted signal arrives at the receiver using various paths of different length). Since multiple versions of the signal interfere with each other (inter symbol interference (ISI)) it becomes very hard to extract the original information. OFDM is sometimes called multi-carrier or discrete multi-tone modulation. It is the modulation technique used for digital TV in Europe, Japan and Australia.},

abstract = {We propose a novel blind image deconvolution (BID) regularization framework for compressive sensing (CS) based imaging systems capturing blurred images. The proposed framework relies on a constrained optimization technique, which is solved by a sequence of unconstrained sub-problems, and allows the incorporation of existing CS reconstruction algorithms in compressive BID problems. As an example, a non-convex lp quasi-norm with is employed as a regularization term for the image, while a simultaneous auto-regressive regularization term is selected for the blur. Nevertheless, the proposed approach is very general and it can be easily adapted to other state-of-the-art BID schemes that utilize different, application specific, image/blur regularization terms. Experimental results, obtained with simulations using blurred synthetic images and real passive millimeter-wave images, show the feasibility of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of inferring sparse causal networks modeled by multivariate autoregressive (MAR) processes. Conditions are derived under which the Group Lasso (gLasso) procedure consistently estimates sparse network structure. The key condition involves a "false connection score" $\psi$. In particular, we show that consistent recovery is possible even when the number of observations of the network is far less than the number of parameters describing the network, provided that $\psi$ {\textless} 1. The false connection score is also demonstrated to be a useful metric of recovery in nonasymptotic regimes. The conditions suggest a modified gLasso procedure which tends to improve the false connection score and reduce the chances of reversing the direction of causal influence. Computational experiments and a real network based electrocorticogram (ECoG) simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

In this review paper, we will point out that the formulation based on only classical-quantum channel mapping model may be inadequate when one takes into account a power constraint for noisy channel. To define the power constraint well, we should explicitly consider how quantum states are conveyed through a transmission channel. Basing on such consideration, we calculate a capacity formula for an attenuated noisy optical channel with genreral Gaussian state input; this gives certain progress beyond the example in our former paper.},

Aimed at students in mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences, it examines the theory of finite groups in a manner both accessible to the beginner and suitable for graduate research. With applications in chemistry, error-correcting codes, data analysis, graph theory, number theory and probability, the book presents a concrete approach to abstract group theory through applied examples, pictures and computer experiments. The author divides the book into two parts. In the first part, she parallels the development of Fourier analysis on the real line and the circle, and then moves on to analog of higher dimensional Euclidean space. The second part emphasizes matrix groups such as the Heisenberg group of upper triangular 2x2 matrices with 1's down the diagonal and entries in a finite field. The book concludes with an introduction to zeta functions on finite graphs via the trace formula.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) is an important recent advance that shows how to reconstruct sparse high dimensional signals from surprisingly small numbers of random measurements. The nonlinear nature of the reconstruction process poses a challenge to understanding the performance of CS. We employ techniques from the statistical physics of disordered systems to compute the typical behavior of CS as a function of the signal sparsity and measurement density. We find surprising and useful regularities in the nature of errors made by CS, a new phase transition which reveals the possibility of CS for nonnegative signals without optimization, and a new null model for sparse regression.},

abstract = {We show that, on a Hilbert space of odd dimension, the only pure states to possess a non-negative Wigner function are stabilizer states. The Clifford group is identified as the set of unitary operations which preserve positivity. The result can be seen as a discrete version of Hudson's Theorem. Hudson established that for continuous variable systems, the Wigner function of a pure state has no negative values if and only if the state is Gaussian. Turning to mixed states, it might be surmised that only convex combinations of stabilizer states give rise to non-negative Wigner distributions. We refute this conjecture by means of a counter-example. Further, we give an axiomatic characterization which completely fixes the definition of the Wigner function and compare two approaches to stabilizer states for Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimensions. In the course of the discussion, we derive explicit formulas for the number of stabilizer codes defined on such systems.},

As we explain, the motivation for considering this problem is that certain pure-state measures of quantum entanglement, which we call polynomial entanglement measures, can be represented as affine algebraic varieties. We consider the evaluation of certain mixed-state extensions of these polynomial entanglement measures, namely convex and concave roofs. We show that the evaluation of a roof-based mixed-state extension is equivalent to calculating a hyperplane which is multiply tangent to the variety in a number of places equal to the number of terms in an optimal decomposition for the measure. In this way we provide an implicit representation of optimal decompositions for mixed-state entanglement measures based on the roof construction.},

abstract = {We study the extent to which sets A in Z/NZ, N prime, resemble sets of integers from the additive point of view (``up to Freiman isomorphism''). We give a direct proof of a result of Freiman, namely that if A + A exp(-cK 2 log K). As a byproduct of our argument we obtain a sharpening of the second author's result on sets with small sumset in torsion groups. For example if A is a subset of F2 n, and if A + A {\textless} KA, then A is contained in a coset of a subspace of size no more than 2 CK 2A.},

@article{Bourgain2010a,
abstract = {We give a new explicit construction of {\$}n\backslashtimes N{\$} matrices satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Namely, for some c{\textgreater}0, large N and any n satisfying N{\^{}}{\{}1-c{\}} {\textless} n {\textless} N, we construct RIP matrices of order k{\^{}}{\{}1/2+c{\}}. This overcomes the natural barrier k=O(n{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}) for proofs based on small coherence, which are used in all previous explicit constructions of RIP matrices. Key ingredients in our proof are new estimates for sumsets in product sets and for exponential sums with the products of sets possessing special additive structure. We also give a construction of sets of n complex numbers whose k-th moments are uniformly small for 1$\backslash$le k$\backslash$le N (Turan's power sum problem), which improves upon known explicit constructions when ($\backslash$log N){\^{}}{\{}1+o(1){\}} $\backslash$le n$\backslash$le ($\backslash$log N){\^{}}{\{}4+o(1){\}}. This latter construction produces elementary explicit examples of n by N matrices that satisfy RIP and whose columns constitute a new spherical code; for those problems the parameters closely match those of existing constructions in the range ($\backslash$log N){\^{}}{\{}1+o(1){\}} $\backslash$le n$\backslash$le ($\backslash$log N){\^{}}{\{}5/2+o(1){\}}.},

abstract = {We describe the structure of the extended Clifford Group (defined to be the group consisting of all operators, unitary and anti-unitary, which normalize the generalized Pauli group (or Weyl-Heisenberg group as it is often called)). We also obtain a number of results concerning the structure of the Clifford Group proper (i.e. the group consisting just of the unitary operators which normalize the generalized Pauli group). We then investigate the action of the extended Clifford group operators on symmetric informationally complete POVMs (or SIC-POVMs) covariant relative to the action of the generalized Pauli group. We show that each of the fiducial vectors which has been constructed so far (including all the vectors constructed numerically by Renes et al) is an eigenvector of one of a special class of order 3 Clifford unitaries. This suggests a strengthening of a conjuecture of Zauner's. We give a complete characterization of the orbits and stability groups in dimensions 2-7. Finally, we show that the problem of constructing fiducial vectors may be expected to simplify in the infinite sequence of dimensions 7, 13, 19, 21, 31,... . We illustrate this point by constructing exact expressions for fiducial vectors in dimensions 7 and 19.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A noisy Gaussian channel is defined as a channel in which an input field mode is subjected to random Gaussian displacements in phase space. We introduce the quantum fidelity of a Gaussian channel for pure and mixed input states, and we derive a universal scaling law of the fidelity for pure initial states. We also find the maximum fidelity of a Gaussian channel over all input states. Quantum cloning and continuous-variable teleportation are presented as physical examples of Gaussian channels to which the fidelity results can be applied.},

abstract = {Significantly revised and expanded, this new Second Edition provides readers at all levels-from beginning students to practicing analysts-with the basic concepts and standard tools necessary to solve problems of analysis, and how to apply these concepts to research in a variety of areas. Authors Elliott Lieb and Michael Loss take you quickly from basic topics to methods that work successfully in mathematics and its applications. While omitting many usual typical textbook topics, Analysis includes all necessary definitions, proofs, explanations, examples, and exercises to bring the reader to an advanced level of understanding with a minimum of fuss, and, at the same time, doing so in a rigorous and pedagogical way. Many topics that are useful and important, but usually left to advanced monographs, are presented in Analysis, and these give the beginner a sense that the subject is alive and growing.},

The present paper gives a self contained treatment of the subject, following as much in parallel as possible with classical information theory and, on the other side, stressing profound differences of the quantum case. An emphasis is made on recent results, such as general quantum coding theorems including cases of infinite (possibly continuous) alphabets and constrained inputs, reliability function for pure state channels and quantum Gaussian channel. Several still unsolved problems are briefly outlined.},

abstract = {Subsampled blind deconvolution is the recovery of two unknown signals from samples of their convolution. To overcome the ill-posedness of this problem, solutions based on priors tailored to specific application have been developed in practical applications. In particular, sparsity models have provided promising priors. However, in spite of empirical success of these methods in many applications, existing analyses are rather limited in two main ways: by disparity between the theoretical assumptions on the signal and/or measurement model versus practical setups; or by failure to provide a performance guarantee for parameter values within the optimal regime defined by the information theoretic limits. In particular, it has been shown that a naive sparsity model is not a strong enough prior for identifiability in the blind deconvolution problem. Instead, in addition to sparsity, we adopt a conic constraint, which enforces spectral flatness of the signals. Under this prior, we provide an iterative algorithm that achieves guaranteed performance in blind deconvolution at near optimal sample complexity. Numerical results show the empirical performance of the iterative algorithm agrees with the performance guarantee.},

@article{Willett2003,
abstract = {The nonparametric multiscale platelet algorithms presented in this paper, unlike traditional wavelet-based methods, are both well suited to photon-limited medical imaging applications involving Poisson data and capable of better approximating edge contours. This paper introduces platelets, localized functions at various scales, locations, and orientations that produce piece-wise linear image approximations, and a new multiscale image decomposition based on these functions. Platelets are well suited for approximating images consisting of smooth regions separated by smooth boundaries. For smoothness measured in certain H{\"{o}}lder classes, it is shown that the error of m-term platelet approximations can decay significantly faster than that of m-term approximations in terms of sinusoids, wavelets, or wedgelets. This suggests that platelets may outperform existing techniques for image denoising and reconstruction. Fast, platelet-based, maximum penalized likelihood methods for photon-limited image denoising, deblurring and tomographic reconstruction problems are developed. Because platelet decompositions of Poisson distributed images are tractable and computationally efficient, existing image reconstruction methods based on expectation-maximization type algorithms can be easily enhanced with platelet techniques. Experimental results suggest that platelet-based methods can outperform standard reconstruction methods currently in use in confocal microscopy, image restoration, and emission tomography.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The ability of grass species to adapt to various habitats is attributed to the dynamic nature of their genomes, which have been shaped by multiple rounds of ancient and recent polyploidization. To gain a better understanding of the nature and extent of variation in functionally relevant regions of a polyploid genome, we developed a sequence capture assay to compare exonic sequences of allotetraploid wheat accessions. RESULTS: A sequence capture assay was designed for the targeted re-sequencing of 3.5 Mb exon regions that surveyed a total of 3,497 genes from allotetraploid wheat. These data were used to describe SNPs, copy number variation and homoeologous sequence divergence in coding regions. A procedure for variant discovery in the polyploid genome was developed and experimentally validated. About 1{\%} and 24{\%} of discovered SNPs were loss-of-function and non-synonymous mutations, respectively. Under-representation of replacement mutations was identified in several groups of genes involved in translation and metabolism. Gene duplications were predominant in a cultivated wheat accession, while more gene deletions than duplications were identified in wild wheat. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that, even though the level of sequence similarity between targeted polyploid genomes and capture baits can bias enrichment efficiency, exon capture is a powerful approach for variant discovery in polyploids. Our results suggest that allopolyploid wheat can accumulate new variation in coding regions at a high rate. This process has the potential to broaden functional diversity and generate new phenotypic variation that eventually can play a critical role in the origin of new adaptations and important agronomic traits.},

@article{Folland2006,
abstract = {The area of Fourier analysis connected to signal processing theory has undergone a rapid development in the last two decades. The aspect of this development that has received the most publicity is the theory of wavelets and their relatives, which involves expansions in terms of sets of functions generated from a single function by translations and dilations. However, there has also been much progress in the related area known as $\backslash$emph{\{}time-frequency analysis{\}} or $\backslash$emph{\{}Gabor analysis{\}}, which involves expansions in terms of sets of functions generated from a single function by translations and modulations. In this area there are some questions of a concrete and practical nature whose study reveals connections with aspects of harmonic and functional analysis that were previously considered quite pure and perhaps rather exotic. In this expository paper, I give a survey of some of these interactions between the abstruse and the applicable. It is based on the thematic lectures which I gave at the Ninth Discussion Meeting on Harmonic Analysis at the Harish-Chandra Research Institute in Allahabad in October 2005.},

abstract="Sparse signal expansions represent or approximate a signal using a small number of elements from a large collection of elementary waveforms. Finding the optimal sparse expansion is known to be NP hard in general and non-optimal strategies such as Matching Pursuit, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, Basis Pursuit and Basis Pursuit De-noising are often called upon. These methods show good performance in practical situations, however, they do not operate on the ℓ                        0 penalised cost functions that are often at the heart of the problem. In this paper we study two iterative algorithms that are minimising the cost functions of interest. Furthermore, each iteration of these strategies has computational complexity similar to a Matching Pursuit iteration, making the methods applicable to many real world problems. However, the optimisation problem is non-convex and the strategies are only guaranteed to find local solutions, so good initialisation becomes paramount. We here study two approaches. The first approach uses the proposed algorithms to refine the solutions found with other methods, replacing the typically used conjugate gradient solver. The second strategy adapts the algorithms and we show on one example that this adaptation can be used to achieve results that lie between those obtained with Matching Pursuit and those found with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, while retaining the computational complexity of the Matching Pursuit algorithm.",

  Abstract                 = {Boson sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers, but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialized quantum computer. Current experimental schemes, however, are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation. A new variation of this task, scattershot boson sampling, leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric down-conversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the interferometer. We report the first scattershot boson sampling experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits. We use recently proposed statistical tools to analyze our experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.},

This SPAD is sensitive in the range 400-1000nm and has a conventional reach-through structure which ensures good quantum efficiency at the long end of the spectrum. By use of passive and active quenching schemes we investigate detection efficiency, timing jitter, dark counts, afterpulsing, gain and other important parameters and compare them to the ``standard'' low noise SPAD C30902SH from Perkin Elmer. We conclude that SAP500 offers better combination of detection efficiency, low noise and timing precision.},

Based on the discrimination, an error-exponent function e(r) is defined. This function is found to describe the behavior of optimum hypothesis testers asymptotically with block length. Next, mutual information is introduced as a minimum of a set of discriminations. This approach has later coding significance. The channel reliability-rate function E(R) is defined in terms of discrimination, and a number of its mathematical properties developed. Sphere-packing-like bounds are developed in a relatively straightforward and intuitive manner by relating e(r) and E (R) . This ties together the aforementioned developments and gives a lower bound in terms of a hypothesis testing model. The result is valid for discrete or continuous probability distributions. The discrimination function is also used to define a source code reliability-rate function. This function allows a simpler proof of the source coding theorem and also bounds the code performance as a function of block length, thereby providing the source coding analog of E (R) .},

abstract = {A boson sampling device is a specialised quantum computer that solves a problem which is strongly believed to be computationally hard for classical computers. Recently a number of small-scale implementations have been reported, all based on multi-photon interference in multimode interferometers. In the hard-to-simulate regime, even validating the device's functioning may pose a problem . In a recent paper, Gogolin et al. showed that so-called symmetric algorithms would be unable to distinguish the experimental distribution from the trivial, uniform distribution. Here we report new boson sampling experiments on larger photonic chips, and analyse the data using a scalable statistical test recently proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov. We show the test successfully validates small experimental data samples against the hypothesis that they are uniformly distributed. We also show how to discriminate data arising from either indistinguishable or distinguishable photons. Our results pave the way towards larger boson sampling experiments whose functioning, despite being non-trivial to simulate, can be certified against alternative hypotheses.},

abstract = {Quantum machine learning has received significant attention in recent years, and promising progress has been made in the development of quantum algorithms to speed up traditional machine learning tasks. In this work, however, we focus on investigating the information-theoretic upper bounds of sample complexity - how many training samples are sufficient to predict the future behaviour of an unknown target function. This kind of problem is, arguably, one of the most fundamental problems in statistical learning theory and the bounds for practical settings can be completely characterised by a simple measure of complexity. Our main result in the paper is that, for learning an unknown quantum measurement, the upper bound, given by the fat-shattering dimension, is linearly proportional to the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space. Learning an unknown quantum state becomes a dual problem to ours, and as a byproduct, we can recover Aaronson's famous result [Proc. R. Soc. A 463:3089-3144 (2007)] solely using a classical machine learning technique. In addition, other famous complexity measures like covering numbers and Rademacher complexities are derived explicitly. We are able to connect measures of sample complexity with various areas in quantum information science, e.g. quantum state/measurement tomography, quantum state discrimination and quantum random access codes, which may be of independent interest. Lastly, with the assistance of general Bloch-sphere representation, we show that learning quantum measurements/states can be mathematically formulated as a neural network. Consequently, classical ML algorithms can be applied to efficiently accomplish the two quantum learning tasks.},

abstract = {The exponential scaling of the wave function is a fundamental property of quantum systems with far reaching implications in our ability to process quantum information. A problem where these are particularly relevant is quantum state tomography. State tomography, whose objective is to obtain a full description of a quantum system, can be analysed in the framework of computational learning theory. In this model, quantum states have been shown to be Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learnable with sample complexity linear in the number of qubits. However, it is conjectured that in general quantum states require an exponential amount of computation to be learned. Here, using results from the literature on the efficient classical simulation of quantum systems, we show that stabiliser states are efficiently PAC-learnable.

abstract = {Traditional quantum state tomography requires a number of measurements that grows exponentially with the number of qubits n. But using ideas from computational learning theory, we show that "for most practical purposes" one can learn a state using a number of measurements that grows only linearly with n. Besides possible implications for experimental physics, our learning theorem has two applications to quantum computing: first, a new simulation of quantum one-way communication protocols, and second, the use of trusted classical advice to verify untrusted quantum advice.},

abstract = {Quantum samplers are believed capable of sampling efficiently from distributions that are classically hard to sample from. We consider a sampler inspired by the Ising model. It is nonadaptive and therefore experimentally amenable. Under a plausible average-case hardness conjecture, classical sampling upto additive errors from this model is known to be hard. We present a trap-based verification scheme for quantum supremacy that only requires the verifier to prepare single-qubit states. The verification is done on the same model as the original sampler, a square lattice, with only a constant factor overhead. We next revamp our verification scheme to operate in the presence of noise by emulating a fault-tolerant procedure without correcting on-line for the errors, thus keeping the model non-adaptive, but verifying supremacy fault-tolerantly. We show that classically sampling upto additive errors is likely hard in our revamped scheme. Our results are applicable to more general sampling problems such as the Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time (IQP) computation model. It should also assist near-term attempts at experimentally demonstrating quantum supremacy and guide long-term ones.},

abstract = {It is predicted that quantum computers will dramatically outperform their conventional counterparts. However, large-scale universal quantum computers are yet to be built. Boson sampling is a rudimentary quantum algorithm tailored to the platform of photons in linear optics, which has sparked interest as a rapid way to demonstrate this quantum supremacy. Photon statistics are governed by intractable matrix functions known as permanents, which suggests that sampling from the distribution obtained by injecting photons into a linear-optical network could be solved more quickly by a photonic experiment than by a classical computer. The contrast between the apparently awesome challenge faced by any classical sampling algorithm and the apparently near-term experimental resources required for a large boson sampling experiment has raised expectations that quantum supremacy by boson sampling is on the horizon. Here we present classical boson sampling algorithms and theoretical analyses of prospects for scaling boson sampling experiments, showing that near-term quantum supremacy via boson sampling is unlikely. While the largest boson sampling experiments reported so far are with 5 photons, our classical algorithm, based on Metropolised independence sampling (MIS), allowed the boson sampling problem to be solved for 30 photons with standard computing hardware. We argue that the impact of experimental photon losses means that demonstrating quantum supremacy by boson sampling would require a step change in technology.},

We use this observation to propose a classical algorithm to simulate the output of a boson sampler fed with photons of partial distinguishability. We find conditions for which this algorithm is efficient, which gives a lower limit on the required indistinguishability to demonstrate a quantum advantage. Under these conditions, adding more photons only polynomially increases the computational cost to simulate a boson sampling experiment.},

abstract = {The laws of quantum mechanics place fundamental limits on the accuracy of measurements and therefore on the estimation of unknown parameters of a quantum system. In this work, we prove lower bounds on the size of confidence regions reported by any region estimator for a given ensemble of probe states and probability of success. Our bounds are derived from a previously unnoticed connection between the size of confidence regions and the error probabilities of a corresponding binary hypothesis test. In group-covariant scenarios, we find that there is an ultimate bound for any estimation scheme which depends only on the representation-theoretic data of the probe system, and we evaluate its asymptotics in the limit of many systems, establishing a general "Heisenberg limit" for region estimation. We apply our results to several examples, in particular to phase estimation, where our bounds allow us to recover the well-known Heisenberg and shot-noise scaling.},

I review the extent to which such experiments currently exist in the areas of free-space molecular diffraction, magnetic biomolecules, quantum optics and Josephson devices, and sketch possible future lines of development of the programme.},

	Annote = {Entanglement in a quantum system can be demonstrated experimentally by performing the measurements prescribed by an appropriate entanglement witness. However, the unavoidable mismatch between the implementation of measurements in practical devices and their precise theoretical modelling generally results in the undesired possibility of false-positive entanglement detection. Such scenarios can be avoided by using the recently developed device-independent entanglement witnesses (DIEWs) for genuine multipartite entanglement. Similarly to Bell inequalities, the only assumption of DIEWs is that consistent measurements are performed locally on each subsystem. No precise description of the measurement devices is required. Here we report an experimental test of DIEWs on up to six entangled 40Ca+ ions. We also demonstrate genuine multipartite quantum nonlocality between up to six parties with the detection loophole closed.},

	Abstract = {We give a constructive proof that all mixed states of N qubits in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the maximally mixed state are separable (unentangled). The construction provides an explicit representation of any such state as a mixture of product states. We give upper and lower bounds on the size of the neighborhood, which show that its extent decreases exponentially with the number of qubits. The bounds show that no entanglement appears in the physical states at any stage of present NMR experiments. Though this result raises questions about NMR quantum computation, further analysis would be necessary to assess the power of the general unitary transformations, which are indeed implemented in these experiments, in their action on separable states.},

We suggest a scheme to implement random circuits in a weighted graph state. The input state is entangled with the weighted graph state and a random circuit is implemented when the experimenter performs local measurements in one fixed basis only. The scheme uses no classical random numbers and is a new and natural application of weighted graph states.},

Two specific implementations that require present technology are put forward for illustrative purposes. The first scheme consists of neutral atoms stored in optical lattices, while the second scheme consists of ions stored in an array of micro-traps. Each atom (ion) supports a two-level system, on which local unitary operations can be performed through a laser beam. A raw interaction between neighboring two-level systems is achieved by conditionally displacing the corresponding atoms (ions). Then, average Hamiltonian techniques are used to achieve evolutions in time according to a large class of Hamiltonians.},

Scaling laws for the decay of entanglement and for its finite-time extinction (sudden death) are derived for different types of reservoirs. The latter is found to increase with N. However, entanglement becomes arbitrarily small, and therefore useless as a resource, much before it completely disappears, around a time which is inversely proportional to the number of particles. We also show that the decay of multiparticle GHZ states can generate bound entangled states.},

	Abstract = {We consider interactions that generate a universal set of quantum gates on logical qubits encoded in a collective-dephasing-free subspace, and discuss their implementations with trapped ions. This allows for the removal of the by-far largest source of decoherence in current trapped-ion experiments, collective dephasing. In addition, an explicit parametrization of all two-body Hamiltonians able to generate such gates without the system's state ever exiting the protected subspace is provided.},

	Abstract = {We present two polarization-based protocols for quantum key distribution. The protocols encode key bits in noiseless subspaces or subsystems and so can function over a quantum channel subjected to an arbitrary degree of collective noise, as occurs, for instance, due to rotation of polarizations in an optical fiber. These protocols can be implemented using only entangled photon-pair sources, single-photon rotations, and single-photon detectors. Thus, our proposals offer practical and realistic alternatives to existing schemes for quantum key distribution over optical fibers without resorting to interferometry or two-way quantum communication, thereby circumventing, respectively, the need for high precision timing and the threat of Trojan horse attacks.},

	Abstract = {Noise and imperfection of realistic devices are major obstacles for implementing quantum cryptography. In particular, birefringence in optical fibers leads to decoherence of qubits encoded in photon polarization. We show how to overcome this problem by doing single qubit quantum communication without a shared spatial reference frame and precise timing. Quantum information will be encoded in pairs of photons using tag operations, which corresponds to the time delay of one of the polarization modes. This method is robust against the phase instability of the interferometers despite the use of time bins. Moreover synchronized clocks are not required in the ideal no photon loss case as they are necessary only to label the different encoded qubits.},

	Abstract = {In quantum communication via noisy channels, the error probability scales exponentially with the length of the channel. We present a scheme of a quantum repeater that overcomes this limitation. The central idea is to connect a string of (imperfect) entangled pairs of particles by using a novel nested purification protocol, thereby creating a single distant pair of high fidelity. Our scheme tolerates general errors on the percent level, it works with a polynomial overhead in time and a logarithmic overhead in the number of particles that need to be controlled locally.},

	Abstract = {A general scheme to perform universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation within decoherence-free subspaces (DFSs) is presented. At most two-qubit interactions are required, and the system remains within the DFS throughout the entire implementation of a quantum gate. We show explicitly how to perform universal computation on clusters of the four-qubit DFS encoding one logical qubit each under spatially symmetric (collective) decoherence. Our results have immediate relevance to quantum computer implementations in which quantum logic is implemented through exchange interactions, such as the recently proposed spin-spin coupled quantum dot arrays and donor-atom arrays.},

The problem addressed here is whether the limit E = 1 can be achieved. It is showed that it can be done by splitting the secret bits between several qubits and forcing Eve to have only a sequential access to the qubits, as proposed by Goldenberg and Vaidman. A protocol with E = 1 based on polarized photons and in which Bob's state discrimination can be implemented with linear optical elements is presented.},

	Abstract = {It is well understood that the use of quantum entanglement significantly enhances the computational power of systems. Much of the attention has focused on Bell states and their multipartite generalizations. However, in the multipartite case it is known that there are several inequivalent classes of states, such as those represented by the W-state and the CHZ-state. Our main contribution is a demonstration of the special computational power of these states in the context of paradigmatic problems from classical distributed computing. Concretely, we show that the W-state is the only pure state that can be used to exactly solve the problem of leader election in anonymous quantum networks. Similarly we show that the GHZ-state is the only one that can be used to solve the problem of distributed consensus when no classical post-processing is considered. These results generalize to a family of W- and GHZ-like states. At the heart of the proofs of these impossibility results lie symmetry arguments.},

	Abstract = {Upon entangling a spatial binary alternative of a photon with its polarization, one can use single photons to study arbitrary 2-qubit states. Sending the photon through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, equipped with sets of wave plates that change the polarization, amounts to performing a unitary transformation on the 2-qubit state. We show that any desired unitary gate can be realized by a judicious choice of the parameters of the setup and discuss a number of applications. They include the diagnosis of an unknown 2-qubit state, an optical Grover search, and the realization of a thought experiment invented by Vaidman. Aharonov. and Albert.},

	Abstract = {Favored schemes for trapped-ion quantum logic gates use bichromatic laser fields to couple internal qubit states with external motion through a "spin-dependent force." We introduce a new degree of freedom in this coupling that reduces its sensitivity to phase decoherence. We demonstrate bichromatic spin-dependent forces on a single trapped Cd-111(+) ion, and show that phase coherence of the resulting entangled states of spin and motion depends critically upon the spectral arrangement of the optical fields. This applies directly to the operation of entangling gates on multiple ions.},

We show here how to eliminate the need for single-qubit operations in a large subset of quantum computer proposals: those governed by isotropic and XXZ, XY-type anisotropic exchange interactions. Our method employs an encoding of one logical qubit into two physical qubits, while logic operations are performed using an analogue of the NMR selective recoupling method.},

The fourth-order quantum correlation function is evaluated and shown to violate the classical Schwarz-type inequality, ensuring that the field does not have a classical analog. We expect these results to be useful in the rapidly growing fields of quantum imaging and quantum information.},

	Abstract = {Wootters [Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 2245 (1998)] has given an explicit formula for the entanglement of formation of two qubits in terms of what he calls the concurrence of the joint density operator. Wootters's concurrence is defined with the help of the superoperator that flips the spin of a qubit. We generalize the spin-flip superoperator to a "universal inverter," which acts on quantum systems of arbitrary dimension, and we introduce the corresponding generalized concurrence for joint pure states of D-1 X D-2 bipartite quantum systems. We call this generalized concurrence the I concurrence to emphasize its relation to the universal inverter. The universal inverter, which is a positive, but not completely positive superoperator, is closely related to the completely positive universal-NOT superoperator, the quantum analogue of a classical NOT gate. We present a physical realization of the universal-NOT Superoperator.},

	Abstract = {Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory. This involves the use of a quantum analog of error correcting codes.},

Surprisingly, we find that the robustness of (GHZ) entanglement increases with the number of qubits. An n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state can stand more than 55% local depolarization in the limit n-->infinity. GHZ states are more robust than other generic states of three and four qubits. We also study spin-squeezed states in the limit n-->infinity and find that they too can stand considerable local depolarization.},

In certain conditions, the interferometer divides the incident beam into the HG(10) and HG(01) components as a transverse-mode beam splitter. We propose a practical device involving the two interferometers for quantum cryptography, in which a photon carries two bits corresponding to the polarization and the transverse mode.},

Each photon carries logd bits of information, increasing the key generation rate of the protocol. The states used in the transmission part of the protocol are invariant under rotations about the propagation direction, making this implementation independent of the alignment between the reference frames of the sender and receiver. and hence appealing for free space QKD. The protocol still works when these reference frames rotate with respect to each other. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{ziczkowski98,
	Abstract = {The question of how many entangled or, respectively, separable states there are in the set of all quantum states is considered. We propose a natural measure in the space of density matrices rho describing N-dimensional quantum systems. We prove that, under this measure, the set of separable states possesses a nonzero volume. Analytical lower and upper bounds of this volume are also derived for N=2X2 and N=2X3 cases. Finally, numerical Monte Carlo calculations allow us to estimate the volume of separable states, providing numerical evidence that it decreases exponentially with the dimension of the composite system. We have also analyzed a conditional measure of separability under the condition of fixed purity. Our results display a clear dualism between purity and separability: entanglement is typical of pure states, while separability is connected with quantum mixtures. In particular, states of sufficiently low purity are necessarily separable. [S1050-2947(98)02808-X].},

	Abstract = {When a composite quantum state interacts with its surroundings, both quantum coherence of individual particles and quantum entanglement will decay. We have shown that under vacuum noise, i.e., during spontaneous emission, two-qubit entanglement may terminate abruptly in a finite time [T. Yu, J.H. Eberly, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004) 140404], a phenomenon termed entanglement sudden death (ESD). An open issue is the behavior of mixed-state entanglement under the influence of classical noise. In this paper we investigate entanglement sudden death as it arises from the influence of classical phase noise on two qubits that are initially entangled but have no further mutual interaction.

	Abstract = {Characterization of quantum dynamics is a fundamental problem in quantum physics and quantum-information science. Several methods are known which achieve this goal, namely standard quantum-process tomography (SQPT), ancilla-assisted process tomography, and the recently proposed scheme of direct characterization of quantum dynamics (DCQD). Here, we review these schemes and analyze them with respect to some of the physical resources they require. Although a reliable figure-of-merit for process characterization is not yet available, our analysis can provide a benchmark which is necessary for choosing the scheme that is the most appropriate in a given situation, with given resources. As a result, we conclude that for quantum systems where two-body interactions are not naturally available, SQPT is the most efficient scheme. However, for quantum systems with controllable two-body interactions, the DCQD scheme is more efficient than other known quantum-process tomography schemes in terms of the total number of required elementary quantum operations.},

A rank-\\$r\\$, order-\\$d\\$, \\$N \\times N \\times \\cdots \\times N\\$ tensor, where \\$r=O(1)\\$, has \\$O(dN)\\$ free variables. On the other hand, prior to our work, the best sample complexity that was achieved in the literature is \\$O\\left(N^\\{\\frac\\{d\\}\\{2\\}\\}\\right)\\$, obtained by solving a tensor nuclear-norm minimization problem. In this paper, we consider the ‘M-norm’, an atomic norm whose atoms are rank-1 sign tensors. We also consider a generalization of the matrix max-norm to tensors, which results in a quasi-norm that we call ‘max-qnorm’. We prove that solving an M-norm constrained least squares (LS) problem results in nearly optimal sample complexity for low-rank tensor completion (TC). A similar result holds for max-qnorm as well. Furthermore, we show that these bounds are nearly minimax rate-optimal. We also provide promising numerical results for max-qnorm constrained TC, showing improved recovery compared to matricization and alternating LS.}",

	abstract = {Encoding and manipulating information in the states of single photons provides a potential platform for quantum computing and communication. Carolan et al. developed a reconfigurable integrated waveguide device fabricated in a glass chip (see the Perspective by Rohde and Dowling). The device allowed for universal linear optics transformations on six wave-guides using 15 integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers, each of which was individually programmable. Functional performance in a number of applications in optics and quantum optics demonstrates the versatility of the device{\textquoteright}s reprogrammable architecture.Science, this issue p. 711; see also p. 696Linear optics underpins fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and quantum technologies. We demonstrate a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is sufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of that circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15 Mach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated into a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for arbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons, and their measurement with a 12-single-photon detector system. We programmed this system to implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with verification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100 Haar random unitaries with an average fidelity of 0.999 {\textpm} 0.001. Our system can be rapidly reprogrammed to implement these and any other linear optical protocol, pointing the way to applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-convex constraints have recently proven a valuable tool in many optimisation problems. In particular sparsity constraints have had a significant impact on sampling theory, where they are used in Compressed Sensing and allow structured signals to be sampled far below the rate traditionally prescribed. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nNearly all of the theory developed for Compressed Sensing signal recovery assumes that samples are taken using linear measurements. In this paper we instead address the Compressed Sensing recovery problem in a setting where the observations are non-linear. We show that, under conditions similar to those required in the linear setting, the Iterative Hard Thresholding algorithm can be used to accurately recover sparse or structured signals from few non-linear observations. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nSimilar ideas can also be developed in a more general non-linear optimisation framework. In the second part of this paper we therefore present related result that show how this can be done under sparsity and union of subspaces constraints, whenever a generalisation of the Restricted Isometry Property traditionally imposed on the Compressed Sensing system holds.},

These methods provide a mathematical basis on which to develop novel algorithms for quantum process tomography—the statistical estimation of superoperators and their generators—from a wide variety of experimental data. Theoretical arguments and numerical simulations are presented which imply that these algorithms will be quite robust in the presence of random errors in the data.},

Model selection can be used to tailor the number of fit parameters to the data, but quantum tomography violates some common assumptions that underly canonical model selection techniques based on ratios of maximum likelihoods (loglikelihood ratio statistics), due to the nature of the state space boundaries. Here, we study the behavior of the maximum likelihood in different Hilbert space dimensions, and derive an expression for a complexity penalty -- the expected value of the loglikelihood ratio statistic (roughly, the logarithm of the maximum likelihood) -- that can be used to make an appropriate choice for d.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum gases in optical lattices offer an opportunity to experimentally realize and explore condensed matter models in a clean, tunable system. We used single atomsingle lattice site imaging to investigate the Bose-Hubbard model on a microscopic level. Our technique enables space- and time-resolved characterization of the number statistics across the superfluidMott insulator quantum phase transition. Site-resolved probing of fluctuations provides us with a sensitive local thermometer, allows us to identify microscopic heterostructures of low-entropy Mott domains, and enables us to measure local quantum dynamics, revealing surprisingly fast transition time scales. Our results may serve as a benchmark for theoretical studies of quantum dynamics, and may guide the engineering of low-entropy phases in a lattice.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We introduce a class of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) which is based on a group symmetry twisted by a 3-cocycle of the group. This twisted symmetry is expressed as a matrix product operator (MPO) with bond dimension greater than1 and acts on the virtual boundary of a \{PEPS\} tensor. We show that it gives rise to a new standard form for \{PEPS\} from which we construct a family of local Hamiltonians which are gapped, frustration-free and include fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Based on this insight, we advance the classification of 2D gapped quantum spin systems by showing how this new standard form for \{PEPS\} determines the emergent topological order of these local Hamiltonians. Specifically, we identify their universality class as DijkgraafWitten topological quantum field theory (TQFT). },

  Abstract                 = {A quantum system will stay near its instantaneous ground state if the Hamiltonian that governs its evolution varies slowly enough. This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems.},

Our approach requires only a standard laser source and intensity measurements to directly and uniquely determine all moduli and non-trivial phases of the matrix describing a network. We experimentally demonstrate the characterization of a \$6\{{\textbackslash}times\}6\$ fiber-optic network and independently verify the results via nonclassical two-photon interference.},

	abstract = {{We analyse several product measures in the space of mixed quantum states. In particular, we study measures induced by the operation of partial tracing. The natural, rotationally invariant measure on the set of all pure states of a N x K composite system, induces a unique measure in the space of N x N mixed states (or in the space of K x K mixed states, if the reduction takes place with respect to the first subsystem). For K = N the induced measure is equal to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure, which is shown to coincide with the measure induced by singular values of non-Hermitian random Gaussian matrices pertaining to the Ginibre ensemble. We compute several, averages with respect to this measure and show that the mean entanglement of N x N pure states behaves as ln N - 1/2.}},

  abstract={The thermalization process of the 2D Kitaev model is studied within the Markovian weak coupling approximation. It is shown that its largest relaxation time is bounded from above by a constant independent of the system size and proportional to exp(2Δ/ kT ), where Δ is an energy gap over the four-fold degenerate ground state. This means that the 2D Kitaev model is not an example of a memory, neither quantum nor classical.}

	Abstract = {In this paper we formulate a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for continuously monitored open quantum systems modelled by quantum Langevin equations. The optimal controller is expressed in terms of a modified conditional state, which we call a risk-sensitive state, that represents measurement knowledge tempered by the control purpose. One of the two components of the optimal controller is dynamic, a filter that computes the risk-sensitive state. The second component is an optimal control feedback function that is found by solving the dynamic programming equation. The optimal controller can be implemented using classical electronics. The ideas are illustrated using an example of feedback control of a two-level atom.},

We describe a bottom-up approach, where a field-theoretic model is subjected to statistical inference and is ultimately controlled. As an example, the formalism is applied to a highly idealized interaction of an atomic ensemble with an optical field. Our aim is to provide a unified outline for the modelling, from first principles, of realistic experiments in quantum control.},

	Abstract = {Measurements continuous in time have been consistently introduced in quantum mechanics and applications worked out, mainly in quantum optics. In this context a quantum filtering theory has been developed giving the reduced state after a measurement when a certain trajectory of the measured observables is registered (the a posteriori states). In this paper a new derivation of filtering equations is presented for the cases of counting processes and of measurement processes of diffusive type. It is also shown that the equation for the a posteriori dynamics in the diffusive case can be obtained, by a suitable limit, from that in the counting case. Moreover, the paper is intended to clarify the meaning of the various concepts involved and to discuss the connections among them. As an illustration of the theory, simple models are worked out.},

A *-algebraic indefinite structure of quantum stochastic (QS) calculus is introduced and a continuity property of generalized nonadapted QS integrals is proved under the natural integrability conditions in an infinitely dimensional nuclear space. The class of nondemolition output QS processes in quantum open systems is characterized in terms of the QS calculus, and the problem of QS nonlinear filtering with respect to nondemolition, continuous measurements is investigated. The stochastic calculus of a posteriori conditional expectations in quantum observed systems is developed and a general quantum filtering stochastic equation for 2 QS process is derived. An application to the description of the spontaneous collapse of the quantum spin under continuous observation is given.},

	Abstract = {{The third edition of Van Kampen's standard work has been revised and updated. The main difference with the second edition is that the contrived application of the quantum master equation in section 6 of chapter XVII has been replaced with a satisfactory treatment of quantum fluctuations. Apart from that throughout the text corrections have been made and a number of references to later developments have been included. From the recent textbooks the following are the most relevant.<br><BR><br>C.W.Gardiner, Quantum Optics (Springer, Berlin 1991)<br>D.T. Gillespie, Markov Processes (Academic Press, San Diego 1992)<br>W.T. Coffey, Yu.P.Kalmykov, and J.T.Waldron, The Langevin Equation (2nd edition, World Scientific, 2004)<br><br>* Comprehensive coverage of fluctuations and stochastic methods for describing them<br>* A must for students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics and physical chemistry}},

We show that under a certain structured random model, robust and stable recovery is possible. The results extend results of Ling and Strohmer (Inverse Probl. 31, 115002 2015), and in particular theoretically explain certain experimental findings from that paper.

  Abstract                 = {A critical question for the field of quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.},

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such {\textquotedblleft}autoencoder{\textquotedblright} networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

abstract = "The uniformity of the cortical architecture and the ability of functions to move to different areas of cortex following early damage strongly suggest that there is a single basic learning algorithm for extracting underlying structure from richly structured, high-dimensional sensory data. There have been many attempts to design such an algorithm, but until recently they all suffered from serious computational weaknesses. This chapter describes several of the proposed algorithms and shows how they can be combined to produce hybrid methods that work efficiently in networks with many layers and millions of adaptive connections."

abstract="Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.",

abstract="We show that the problem of accumulating Jacobian matrices by using a minimal number of floating-point operations is NP-complete by reduction from Ensemble Computation. The proof makes use of the fact that, deviating from the state-of-the-art assumption, algebraic dependences can exist between the local partial derivatives. It follows immediately that the same problem for directional derivatives, adjoints, and higher derivatives is NP-complete, too.",
